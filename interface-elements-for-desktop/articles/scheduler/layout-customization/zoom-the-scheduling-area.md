# Zoom the Scheduling Area
You can zoom in the scheduler view to display its content in greater detail, or zoom out for a more general view. Zooming is implemented by adjusting the time scales (in the Day, Work-Week or Timeline [views](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/scheduler/layout-customization/switch-scheduler-views.md)) or changing the number of visible weeks (in the Month view).

Zooming operations are available for you via the **CTRL+PLUS SIGN**, **CTRL+MINUS SIGN** or **CTRL+MOUSE WHEEL** key combinations.

If a scheduler is provided with the Bar or Ribbon interface, you can zoom in and zoom out the scheduler area using the corresponding buttons on the **Navigate** [toolbar](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/scheduler/scheduler-ui/toolbars.md) or [Ribbon page group](../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/scheduler/scheduler-ui/ribbon-interface.md).

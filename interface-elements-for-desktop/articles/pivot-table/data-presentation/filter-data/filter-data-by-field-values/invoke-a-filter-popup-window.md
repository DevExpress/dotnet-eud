# Invoke a Filter Popup Window
You can invoke a Filter Window from the Pivot Table or from a Field List (to learn about Field Lists, see [Field List Overview](../../../field-list-overview.md)).

## Invoke a Filter Window from the Pivot Table
Field headers display special buttons used to invoke a Filter Window. Follow the steps below:
1. Hover over the header of a field whose data you need to filter. A filter button (the ![EU_XtraPivotGrid_FilterButton](../../../../../images/img7613.png) icon) will be highlighted.

First, invoke a Field List. For information on how to do this, see [Invoke a Field List](../../../field-list/invoke-a-field-list.md).

To open a Filter Window, click the filter button displayed in the field header.

# Build Complex Filter Criteria
To build complex filter criteria consisting of multiple filter clauses using various filter operators, you can use a Filter Editor:

![EU_XtraPivotGrid_PreFilter](../../../../images/img7617.png)

To invoke a Filter, click an empty space within the Pivot Table header region and select **Show Filter** from the context menu.

![EU_XtraPivotGrid_ShowFieldListMenu](../../../../images/img7594.png)

After you have built and applied a filter condition, a filter panel appears at the Pivot Table bottom. This panel displays the filter condition.

![pivotgrid_PrefilterPanel](../../../../images/img13154.png)

To modify a filter condition, open a Filter. You can now do it by clicking the **Edit Filter** button.

To temporarily disable filtering, uncheck the ![EU_XtraPivotGrid_FilterPanel_EnableButton](../../../../images/img7619.png) button.

To remove filtering, click the ![EU_XtraPivotGrid_FilterPanel_CloseButton](../../../../images/img7620.png) button.

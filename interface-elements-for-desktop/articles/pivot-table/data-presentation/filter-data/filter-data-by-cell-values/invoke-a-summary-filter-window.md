# Invoke a Summary Filter Window
To enable and configure filtering by cell values, use the Summary Filter Window.

You can invoke a Summary Filter Window from the Pivot Table or from a Field List (to learn about Field Lists, see [Field List Overview](../../../field-list-overview.md)).

## Invoke a Summary Filter Window from the Pivot Table
Field headers located in the Data Area display special buttons used to invoke a Summary Filter Window. Follow the steps below.
1. Hover over the header of a field whose data you need to filter. A filter button (![EU_XtraPivotGrid_FilterButton](../../../../../images/img7613.png)) will be highlighted.

# Filter Data in Pivot Tables
By default, the Pivot Table processes all records when calculating its values. Data filtering allows you to process only those records that meet your requirements.

Topics in this section describe three ways of filtering data in Pivot Tables - filtering by field values, filtering by cell values and building complex filter criteria.

The following sections and topics are available.
* [Filter Data by Field Values](filter-data/filter-data-by-field-values.md)
	
	Contains topics that describe how to specify simple filter conditions via Filter Windows.
* [Filter Data by Cell Values](filter-data/filter-data-by-cell-values.md)
	
	Contains topics that describe how to specify which cell values to display and which to hide.
* [Build Complex Filter Criteria](filter-data/build-complex-filter-criteria.md)
	
	Describes the Filter Editor that allows you to build complex filter criteria.

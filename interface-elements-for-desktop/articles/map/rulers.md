# Rulers
You can use rulers to measure distances and areas on a map.

## Measure Distances

Click  the ![Distance ruler button](../../images/map-ruler-distance-icon.png) button to create a distance ruler. This ruler calculates the distance between two or more points on a map. The total distance is shown in a map callout. Note that measurements ignore changes in elevation.

Click an intermediate point on the ruler to see the distance to this point.

## Measure Areas 
Click ![Area ruler button](../../images/map-ruler-area-icon.png) button to create an area ruler. This ruler calculates the area inside a polygon. The result is shown in a map callout.

## Configure Rulers

After you add a ruler to a map, you can perform the following actions:

* **Add a ruler point**.  Click the position on the ruler where you want to add a point.

* **Change the ruler polyline**. Click and drag the point to a new location.

    ![ Move a ruler point](../../images/map-ruler-move-point.gif)

* **Delete a ruler point**. Double-click the ruler point. You can delete a point when the ruler contains more than two points. You can remove only the entire ruler if it contains two points.

## Measure Distances

Click  the ![Distance ruler button](../../images/map-ruler-distance-icon.png) button to create a distance ruler. This ruler calculates the distance between two or more points on a map. The total distance is shown in a map callout. Note that measurements ignore changes in elevation.

Click an intermediate point on the ruler to see the distance to this point.

## Measure Areas 
Click ![Area ruler button](../../images/map-ruler-area-icon.png) button to create an area ruler. This ruler calculates the area inside a polygon. The result is shown in a map callout.

The **Window** menu allows for the disabling of the tabbed multi-document interface and the tiling of [Design Panel](../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-reference/report-designer-ui/design-panel.md) windows vertically or horizontally. |

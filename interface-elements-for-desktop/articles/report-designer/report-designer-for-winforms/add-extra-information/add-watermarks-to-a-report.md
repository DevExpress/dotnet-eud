	In the invoked **Select Picture** dialog, select the file containing the image that you wish to use as a watermark and click **Open**. Next, specify the size mode and alignment options for the picture.
	
	Additionally, for both textual and picture watermarks, you can adjust the transparency, position (in front of or behind the document content), and the page range in which the watermark will be printed.

## <a name="preprintedform"></a>Supply a Preprinted Form
You can use a picture watermark as a template, to display an image of the preprinted form on the report's body at design time.

To display a watermark at design time, switch to the [toolbar](..\report-designer-tools\toolbar.md)'s **View** page and activate  **Watermark**.

title: Save the Connection String
---
> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. In this instance, familiarity with database connections is required, so we recommend that you contact your application administrator or vendor for assistance. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with the [Choose Columns to Display in Your Report](../../../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-wizard/data-bound-report/choose-columns-to-display-in-your-report.md) wizard page.

On this page, you can specify whether or not to save the user credentials along with the connection string.

# Bind a Report to Union-Based Federated Data Source

You can create a federated data source for your report to display data combined from several sources. This topic demonstrates how to use the **Union** and **UnionAll** operations to combine data into a single query.

## Create a Report and Data Sources

1. [Create a new blank report](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/report-wizard/blank-report.md).

2. [Add a SQL data source](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/bind-to-data/bind-a-report-to-a-database.md) that provides one data table.

3. [Add an Excel data source](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/bind-to-data/bind-a-report-to-an-excel-workbook.md) that provides the other data table.

## Create Data Federation and Bind the Report to It

1. Click the report's smart tag, expand the **DataSource** property's drop-down menu and click **Add Report Data Source**.

2. In the invoked [Data Source Wizard](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/data-source-wizard.md), select **Data Federation** and click **Next**.

3. On the next page, click **Add Query**.

4. In the invoked [Query Builder](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/query-builder.md) (adapted to federated data sources), choose **Union** as a query type.

    Or you can choose **Union All**.

5. Double-click the **Customers** table and the **Excel data source**. The two sources are added to the query.

    The query includes only fields that have identical names and types in the origin sources.

6. Enable check boxes for the data fields you want to include in the query result set.

7. Rename fields.

8. Click **OK** to close the Query Builder. Click **Finish** to complete the Data Source Wizard.
 
The Wizard creates a new **FederationDataSource** that includes the single **Customers** query. This data source becomes available in the [Report Explorer](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/ui-panels/report-explorer.md)'s **Components** node. The [Field List](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) reflects the data source structure.

The federated query's default name equals to the first source's name (the **Customers** table in this tutorial). You can rename this query in the **Manage Queries** dialog. To invoke it, right-click the data source in the Field List or Report Explorer and select **Manage Queries** in the context menu.

Once you rename the query, update the report's **DataMember** property.

## Design the Report Layout

1. Click the report's smart tag and select **Design in Report Wizard**.

    ![](../../../../images/DataFederationUnion-design-in-report-wizard.png)

2. In the invoked [Report Wizard](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/report-wizard.md), select **Table Report** and click **Next**.

    ![](../../../../images/data-federation-report-wizard-table-report.png)

3. Select data fields to display in the report and click **Finish**. You can also go to the [next page](../../../../articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-winforms/report-designer-tools/report-wizard/table-report/add-grouping-levels.md) to continue layout creation.

    ![](../../../../images/DataFederationUnion-report-wizard-select-fields.png)

The resulting layout looks similar to the following image:

Switch to the Preview tab to see the report document. It displays contacts from the Customers and Suppliers tables.

> [!Note]
> Duplicate contacts from the Customers and Suppliers tables are not removed in the **Union All** mode.

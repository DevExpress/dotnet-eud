# Field List

This panel displays the schemas of a reportâ€™s data sources.

![Field List](../../../../../images/eurd-win-field-list.png)

Right-click a data source to access its settings. For instance, you can add the data source to the [Report Gallery](report-gallery.md) to reuse it in other reports.

![Field List - Add Data Source to Report Gallery](../../../../../images/eurd-win-field-list-data-source-add-to-gallery.png)

The Field List allows you to do the following:

## Search fields

Enter a search string in the search box. The Field List filters fields and tables to match the entered string.

## Bind controls to data

Drop a field onto a report's surface to create a new report control bound to this field.

![Field List - Drop Field Onto the Surface](../../../../..//images/eurd-win-field-list-drop-fields.png)

Drop a field onto an existing report control to bind this control to the field.

![Field List - Drop Field Onto a Control](../../../../../images/eurd-win-field-list-drop-field-to-control.png)

Hold the CTRL key when you drop a field on top of an existing control to keep the control's current data binding setting. In this case, a new report control is created.

**Select which control to create**

Do any of the following:

* Hold the SHIFT key when you drop a data field onto the report surface.
* Right-click a data field and drop it onto the report surface.

This invokes a context menu where you can select which control to create.

## Create tables

Drop an entire data table onto the report to create a report table with columns bound to the data table's fields.

![Field List - Drop Table](../../../../../images/eurd-win-field-list-drop-table.png)

Hold the CTRL or SHIFT key to select multiple data fields in the Field List. Drop these fields onto the report to create a report table that only has the selected fields.

![Field List - Select Specific Fields](../../../../../images/eurd-win-list-drop-multiple-fields.png)

Hold the SHIFT key when you drop the selected fields onto the report to only create column headers. This creates a new table whose cells display the selected field names. Alternatively, you can drag and drop fields with the right mouse button.

## Data shaping operations

The Field List can help you do the following:

* Add [calculated fields](../../shape-report-data/use-calculated-fields/calculated-fields-overview.md) to data tables.

* Add [report parameters](../../shape-report-data/use-report-parameters.md) or change existing parameters.

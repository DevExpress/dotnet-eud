# Bind to a Stored Procedure
> [!NOTE]
> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with the [Choose Fields to Display in a Report](../choose-fields-to-display-in-a-report.md) wizard page.

This wizard page allows you to add stored procedures to the data source, configure their parameters and preview the results of a stored procedureâ€™s execution.

To bind to a stored procedure, do the following.
1. Click **Add**. Then, in the invoked window, select a required stored procedure and click **OK**.
	
2. [Configure the parameters](../../../../shape-report-data/use-report-parameters/use-query-parameters.md) to be passed to the selected stored procedure. Make sure that the value of the passed parameter's **Type** property corresponds to the actual type of the stored procedure parameter.

Click **Next** to proceed to the next wizard page. If you have added more than one stored procedures on this page or if the current Entity Framework model additionally provides data tables, go to the [Select a Data Member](select-a-data-member.md) page. Otherwise, proceed to the [Choose Fields to Display in a Report](../choose-fields-to-display-in-a-report.md) page.

# Choose Columns
> [!NOTE]
> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with [Choose Fields to Display in a Report](../choose-fields-to-display-in-a-report.md) wizard page.

On this wizard page, you can select required columns and specify their settings.

To select a column, enable the corresponding **Selected** check box. Use **Name** to specify the custom column name and **Type** to choose the column type.

# Maintain the Band Location on a Page

Use the [Group and Report Footer](../introduction-to-banded-reports.md)'s **Print At Bottom** property to choose whether these bands should appear at the bottom of a page or immediately after the previous band.

Use the Page Header and Footer's **Print On** property to avoid printing these bands on the same page with a Report Header and/or Footer.

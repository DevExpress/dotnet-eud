# Conditionally Change a Control's Appearance

This document describes how to change a report control's appearance based on a specific condition.

> [!Warning]
> Use the approach below if expression bindings **are not enabled** in the Report Designer (the [Property Grid](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/property-grid.md) does not provide the **PropertyName Expression** item in the property marker's context menu).
>
> See [Conditionally Change a Control's Appearance](../shape-data-expression-bindings/conditionally-change-a-control-appearance.md) if expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer.

6. In the invoked **Formatting Rules Editor**, move the rule to the list of active rules on the right using the arrow buttons in the center of the editor.

    In this editor, you can also customize the precedence of formatting rules using the up and down arrow buttons on the right of the dialog box. The rules are applied in the same order that they appear in the list, and the last rule in the list has the highest priority.

Switch to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md) to view the resulting report.

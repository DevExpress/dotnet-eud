# Conditionally Suppress Controls

This document describes how to display or hide a report control in a published document based on a specified logical condition.

> [!Warning]
> Use the approach below if expression bindings **are not enabled** in the Report Designer (the [Property Grid](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/property-grid.md) does not provide the **PropertyName Expression** item in the property marker's context menu).
>
> See [Conditionally Suppress Controls](../shape-data-expression-bindings/conditionally-supress-controls.md)  if expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer.

1. [Create a new report](../../add-new-reports.md) or open an existing one and prepare the report layout.

2. Select the required control and click its smart tag. In the invoked actions list, click the **Formatting Rules** property's ellipsis button.

	Click **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog. Then, click **Close** to quit the **Formatting Rule Sheet Editor**.

6. In the **Formatting Rules Editor**, you can see the created rule (called **formattingRule1**), which should be moved to the list of active rules on the right using the arrow buttons in the center of the dialog box.

	In this editor, you can also customize the precedence of formatting rules using the up and down arrow buttons on the right of the dialog box. The rules are applied in the same order that they appear in the list, and the last rule in the list has the highest priority.

When switching to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md), you can view the report control's visibility changes according to the assigned condition.

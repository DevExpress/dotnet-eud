Follow the steps below to calculate a weighted average:

1. [Open an existing report](../../open-reports.md) or [create a new one from scratch](../../add-new-reports.md).
2. [Bind a report](../../bind-to-data.md) to a required data source.
3. [Group the report's data](../../shape-report-data/group-and-sort-data/group-data.md) using the [Group and Sort Panel](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/group-and-sort-panel.md) and construct a layout like the following:

4. Add the [Group Footer](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band to the report and drop a [Label](../../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/label.md) control on this band to display the summary result.	Click the label's smart tag, then click the Summary field's ellipsis button.

5. In the invoked **Summary Editor** window:
    * Set the **Summary Running** property to **Group**.
    * Set the **Summary Function** property to **Weighed average**.
    * Set the **Argument Expression** property to the field to count the weighted average on, and the **Weight** property to the field that provides weights.

6. You can also use the control's **Format String** property to format the summary value. For instance, set this property to **Weighted Average Price: {0:c2}**.

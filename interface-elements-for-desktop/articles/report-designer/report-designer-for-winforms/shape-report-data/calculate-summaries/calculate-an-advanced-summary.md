# Calculate an Advanced Summary

This document describes how to calculate an advanced summary for report groups using a built-in summary function and arithmetical or logical functions.

> [!NOTE]
> Use this approach if expressions **are enabled** in the Report Designer (the Label's smart tag includes the **Expression** property).

1. [Create a new report](../../add-new-reports.md) or open an existing one and [bind it to a data source](../../bind-to-data.md).

2. Switch to the [Group and Sort](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/group-and-sort-panel.md) panel and group the report's data by the required field. Display the footer for the created group.

3. Drop a [Label](../../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/label.md) onto the group footer to display the summary result.

    Click the label's smart tag and set its **Summary** property to **Group**.

4. Click the **Expression** property's ellipsis button.

5. This invokes the **Summary Expression Editor** where you can specify a custom expression with the required summary functions and other logical or arithmetical functions. For example:

	> [!TIP]
	> See the [Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions](../../use-expressions/expression-syntax.md) topic for a complete list of supported summary functions.

6. You can use the **Format String** property to format the summary's value.

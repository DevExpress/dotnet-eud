# Shape Data (Expression Bindings)

The tutorials in this section illustrate how to solve various tasks related to shaping report data when expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer (the [Property Grid](../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/property-grid.md) provides the **Expressions** ![](../../../../images/eurd-win-property-grid-expressions-icon.png) tab ).

> See the [Shape Data (Data Bindings)](shape-data-data-bindings.md) section if expression bindings **are not enabled** in the Report Designer (the [Property Grid](../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/property-grid.md) does not provide the **Expressions** ![](../../../../images/eurd-win-property-grid-expressions-icon.png) tab).

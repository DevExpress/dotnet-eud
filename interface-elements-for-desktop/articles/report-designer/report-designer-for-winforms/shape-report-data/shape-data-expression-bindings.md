# Shape Data (Expression Bindings)

The tutorials in this section illustrate how to solve various tasks related to shaping report data when expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer (the [Property Grid](../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/property-grid-tabbed-view.md) provides the **PropertyName Expression** item in the property marker's context menu).

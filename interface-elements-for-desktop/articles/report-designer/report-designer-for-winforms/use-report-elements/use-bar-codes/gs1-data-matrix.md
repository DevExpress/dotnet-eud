# GS1- Data Matrix

The **GS1 Data Matrix** uses a special start combination to differentiate the **GS1 DataMatrix** symbol from other **Data Matrix ECC 200** symbols. This is achieved by using the **Function 1 Symbol Character** (**FNC1**) in the first position of the encoded data. It enables scanners to process the information according to the **GS1 System Rules**.

* **Human-Readable Text**

    Specifies whether or not parentheses should be included in the bar code's text to improve the readability of the bar code's text.

# Code 93 Extended

Using **Code 93**'s "Full ASCII Mode", it is possible to encode all **128** ASCII characters. This is accomplished by using the (**$**), (**/**), (**%**), and (**&#0043;**) symbols as "shift" characters. These characters combined with the single character that follows indicate which Full ASCII character is to be used.

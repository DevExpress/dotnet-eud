# EAN 13

**EAN-13**, based upon the **UPC-A** standard, was implemented by the International Article Numbering Association (EAN) in Europe. At present, the **GS1** organization is responsible for the maintenance of bar code standards.

The **EAN-13** bar code contains **13** digits, no letters or other characters. The first two or three digits represent the country. The leading zero actually signifies the USA, and **UPC-A** coding. The last digit is the "check digit", the checksum. The check digit is calculated using the first twelve figures when the bar code is constructed. So, for the correct **EAN-13** code, you should specify only the first **12** digits.

The recommended dimensions are shown in the following image. The standard allows magnification up to **200**%, and reduction of up to **80**% of the recommended size.

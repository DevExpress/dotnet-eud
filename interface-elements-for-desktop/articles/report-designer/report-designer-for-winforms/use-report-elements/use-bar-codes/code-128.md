# Code 128

**Code 128** is a very effective, high-density symbology which permits the encoding of alphanumeric data. The symbology includes a checksum digit for verification, and the bar code can also be verified character-by-character, allowing the parity of each data byte to be verified.

This symbology has been widely implemented in many applications where a relatively large amount of data must be encoded in a relatively small amount of space. Its specific structure also allows numerical data to be effectively encoded at double-density.

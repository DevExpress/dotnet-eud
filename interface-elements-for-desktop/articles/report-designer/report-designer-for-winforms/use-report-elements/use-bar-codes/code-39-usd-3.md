# Code 39 (USD-3)

**Code 39**, the first alpha-numeric symbology to be developed, is still widely used, particularly in non-retail environments. It is the standard barcode used by the United States Department of Defense, and is also used by the Health Industry Barcode Council (HIBCC). **Code 39** is also known as "**3 of 9 Code**" and "**USD-3**".

# UPC Shipping Container Symbol (ITF-14)

The **UPC Shipping Container Symbol** (**ITF-14**) bar code is used to mark packaging materials that contain products labeled with a **UPC** or **EAN** product identification number.

This bar code provides a **GS1** implementation of an **Interleaved 2 of 5** bar code for encoding a **Global Trade Item Number** (an identifier for trade items developed by **GS1**). This bar code always uses a total of **14** digits.

The thick black border around the symbol (the **Bearer Bar**) is intended to improve bar code reading reliability.

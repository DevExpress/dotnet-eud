# Enable the Right-To-Left Layout

The report and most of the report controls provide the **Right to Left** property.

This property specifies content layout within a control (for most controls, this property affects the direction of their text, and for the [Check Box](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/check-box.md), this property also affects the check box position within the control).

* **Right-To-Left**

By default, all report controls have this property set to **Inherit**, so enabling it for a report will apply this setting to all its controls.

The following controls support this feature:

* [Label](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/label.md)
* [Check Box](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/check-box.md)
* [Page Info](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/page-info.md)
* [Panel](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/panel.md)
* [Pivot Grid](../use-report-elements/use-charts-and-pivot-grids.md)
* [Table](../use-report-elements/use-tables.md)
* [Table of Contents](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/table-of-contents.md)

For the **Panel** and **Table**, this option only affects the controls contained in them.

When the **Right to Left** property of a report is set to **Yes**, you can also enable the **Right To Left Layout** property that specifies the position of controls within [report bands](../introduction-to-banded-reports.md). Enabling the right-to-left layout will also swap the page margins of a document (it will become impossible to place controls outside the right page margin).

The controls' coordinates will remain unchanged and only the point and direction of reference will change (the X coordinate will be calculated starting with the top right corner).

The right-to-left layout is preserved when exporting a report to any of the [supported formats](../preview-print-and-export-reports.md) (e.g., PDF, Excel, or RTF).

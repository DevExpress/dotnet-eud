# Report Designer Reference
A report is built from **controls** (text labels, images, zip codes, charts, etc) spread across report sections called **bands** (various headers, footers and content sections). The main interface elements helping you manage these building blocks are **Control Toolbox**, **Field List** and **Property Grid**. These elements allow you add controls to your report, bind them to data and change their appearance and behavior settings, respectively.

To learn more about these and other elements used in the Report Designer, use the following links.

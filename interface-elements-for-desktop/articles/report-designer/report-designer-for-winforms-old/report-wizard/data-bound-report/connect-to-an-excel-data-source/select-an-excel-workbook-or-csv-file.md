> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with [Choose Columns to Display in Your Report](../choose-columns-to-display-in-your-report.md) wizard page.

On this wizard page, select a required Microsoft Excel Workbook (the XLS, XLSX and XLSM formats are supported) or CSV file. To do this, click the ellipsis button and locate the source file or enter the full path to this file.

# Choose a Report Layout
This wizard page allows you to specify the layout of elements in a report. If you have not applied data grouping, you can specify how data field values are arranged - into a table, one under another, etc. If report data is grouped, you can choose one of the available indentation styles for nested elements.

Additionally, this page allows you to specify the page orientation for your report.

The following options are available if data grouping has been applied.

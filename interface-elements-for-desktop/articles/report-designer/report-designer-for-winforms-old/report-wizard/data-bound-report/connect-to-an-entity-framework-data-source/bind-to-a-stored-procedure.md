# Bind to a Stored Procedure
> [!NOTE]
> This wizard step appears only if you're creating a new report from scratch. If you're modifying an existing report, this step will not appear and you will start with the [Choose Columns to Display in Your Report](../choose-columns-to-display-in-your-report.md) wizard page.

This wizard page allows you to add stored procedures to the data source, configure their parameters and preview the results of a stored procedureâ€™s execution.

To bind to a stored procedure, do the following.
1. On the wizard page, click **Add**. Then, in the invoked window, select a required stored procedure and click **OK**.

Otherwise, proceed to the [Choose Columns to Display in Your Report](../choose-columns-to-display-in-your-report.md) page.

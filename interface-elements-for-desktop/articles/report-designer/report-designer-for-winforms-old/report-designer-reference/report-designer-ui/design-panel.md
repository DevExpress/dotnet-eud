# Design Panel
The **Design Panel** is the Report Designer's main area, where a report is being constructed and previewed.

On the [Designer Tab](designer-tab.md), multiple reports can be opened at once (each in its own Design Panel).

The Design Panel provides the following tabs (switched at the bottom).
* [Designer Tab](designer-tab.md)
	
	Allows you to modify your report.
* [Preview Tab](preview-tab.md)
	
	Shows a print preview, and enables you to print out your report or export it to a file on disk.
* [HTML View Tab](html-view-tab.md)
	
	Shows the report output in HTML format.
* [Scripts Tab](scripts-tab.md)
	
	Allows you to manage your report's scripts.

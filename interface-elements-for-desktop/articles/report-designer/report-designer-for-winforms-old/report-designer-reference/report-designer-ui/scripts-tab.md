# Scripts Tab
The **Scripts Tab** allows you to manage your report's scripts. It provides centralized access to all the scripts being written for a report or any of its elements ([bands](../report-bands.md) and [controls](../report-controls.md)).

The built-in scripts validation capability is provided in this tab. After clicking **Validate**, the result is displayed in the [Scripts Errors Panel](scripts-errors-panel.md).

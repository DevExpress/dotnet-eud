# Scripts Errors Panel
The **Scripts Errors Panel** displays the result of scripts validation after it's forced in the [Scripts Tab](scripts-tab.md).

Then, if errors are located, they are listed in this panel. To get to the corresponding line of code, click the corresponding item in the panel's list.

# Localization Editor

The Localization Editor allows you to change the text of the localizable textual properties for all the controls in a report.

The left panel allows you to change the report's language or add a new language to start localization.
The right panel contains a grid that displays the property name, the text specified for that property in the default language, and the text for the selected language. Text strings of the selected language are editable.

> [!Tip]

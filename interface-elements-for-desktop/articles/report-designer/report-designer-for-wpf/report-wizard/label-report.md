# Label Report
The **Report Wizard** allows you to create reports of three kinds: [empty reports](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-wizard/empty-report.md), [data-bound reports](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-wizard/data-bound-report.md) and **label reports**. To generate a label report, select **Label Report** and click **Next**.

After completing the Label Report Wizard, you will get a blank report that generates labels of a specifc size. The report designer will indicate the label boundaries and properly position labels within paper sheets. You can then populate the label area with the required content and print out your labels.

Label creation consists of the following two steps.
* [Select the Label Type](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-wizard/label-report/select-the-label-type.md)
* [Customize the Label Options](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/report-wizard/label-report/customize-the-label-options.md)

title: Document Map Panel
---
The **Document Map** panel is an interactive table of contents, which reflects a report's structure in a tree-like form and provides quick navigation through its [bookmarks](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/creating-reports/report-navigation-and-interactivity/add-bookmarks.md).

If a report contains at least one control with a specified bookmark, the **Document Map** is displayed by default. You can then toggle this panel's visibility state using the **Document Map** button ![WPFDesigner_PreviewToolbar_DocumentMap](../../../../images/Img120178.png) in the [Toolbar](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/report-designer/report-designer-for-wpf/document-preview/preview-toolbar.md). If a report does not contain bookmarks, this panel cannot be shown.

Click a bookmark in the **Document Map** to navigate the Print Preview to the corresponding element in a report document.

Note that after exporting a report to the PDF format, the **Document Map** is exported as well.

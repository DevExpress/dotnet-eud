# Create a Chart-Based Report
This tutorial describes the steps used to add a chart to your Snap report. Snap supports many chart types, as well as multiple visual appearance settings and chart palettes.

Do the following steps to create a chart-based report.
1. Create a new Snap document and [bind it to the required table](../connect-to-data/connect-a-document-to-a-data-source.md).
2. Click the **Chart** command in the [Insert](../graphical-user-interface/main-toolbar/general-tools-insert.md) tab of the main toolbar.

3. In the created chart, the blue circles correspond to the values and arguments of the chart. Drop one field from the [Data Explorer](../graphical-user-interface/snap-application-elements/data-explorer.md) onto the "arguments" region in the chart...

4. You can change the default chart type to one that best meets your requirements by selecting the chart and switching to the [Design](../graphical-user-interface/main-toolbar/chart-tools-design.md) tab of the main toolbar.

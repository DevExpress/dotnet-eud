# Storing Reports
Snap provides the capability to store a report to a file and restore it. To retain all Snap-specific features, [save your report](save-a-report.md) in the Snap native document format (**.SNX**). You can also [export your report](export-a-report.md) to one of file formats listed below, but in this case, Snap fields will be replaced with their values and data connection information will be removed.

Supported document formats for export:
* **DOC** (Microsoft&#174; Word&#174; 97 - 2003 document);
* **DOCX** (Office&#174; Open XML document);
* **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language);
* **MHTML** / **MHT** (Web archive, single file);
* **PDF** (Portable Document Format);
* **RTF** (Rich Text Format);
* **TXT** (Plain text);
* **ODT** (OpenDocument text format);
* **XML** (Microsoft&#174; Word&#174; XML document);
* **Image** (BMP, EMF, WMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG or TIFF format).

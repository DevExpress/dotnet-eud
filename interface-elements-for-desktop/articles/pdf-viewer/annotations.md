# Annotations

You can use annotations to highlight important text the author should change, for example, when you review a document.

The PDF Viewer allows you to create text annotations (sticky notes) and text markup annotations (text highlights). All document annotations are displayed in the **Comments** panel.

## Add Replies and Reviews to the Annotation

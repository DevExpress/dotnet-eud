The **Page Thumbnails** panel provides the following options.
* **Print Pages...** -   invokes the **Print** dialog in which you can print pages that correspond to the selected thumbnails.
	
	Use this option after a thumbnail is selected. If there are no selected thumbnails in the panel, the **Page range** option in the **Print** dialog is set to **All**. This means that all pages in a document can be printed.
* **Enlarge Page Thumbnails** - increases the page thumbnails size.
* **Reduce Page Thumbnails** - decreases the page thumbnails size.

You can also enlarge/reduce thumbnail size using one of the following ways:
* press **Ctrl** on the keyboard and scroll the mouse wheel when the **Page Thumbnails** panel is focused;
* use the zoom slider which is placed on the **Page Thumbnails panel**.

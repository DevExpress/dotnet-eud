In the **Find** dialog, type the text you want to search for and specify the following settings (if required):

* The **Case Sensitive** option specifies whether to ignore the letter case when searching text.

* The **Whole Words Only** option only considers whole words when searching text. For example, it does not find the word **types** when you search for **type**.

* To start searching, click the **Next** button in the **Find** dialog, or press the **ENTER** key when the PDF Viewer shows the **Find** dialog.

The PDF Viewer stops searching when it finds the first occurrence of the search text, highlights the occurrence and navigates to the highlighted text.

To search for the next match, click  the **Next** button in the **Find** dialog, or press the **ENTER** key again when the PDF Viewer shows the **Find** dialog. 

To go to the previous match, click the **Previous** button.

The PDF Viewer shows the following message when it finds the final occurrence of the search text or there were no results that match the search text.

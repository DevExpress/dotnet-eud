# Insert a Picture
You can insert graphics in the document, and convert it to inline or floating. 

The **Rich Text Editor** supports the following graphic types:
* Bitmap (*.bmp, *.dib)
* JPEG File Interchange Format (*.jpg, *.jpeg)
* Portable Network Graphics (*.png)
* Graphics Interchange Format (*.gif)
* Tagged Image Format (*.tif, *.tiff)
* Microsoft Enhanced Metafile (*.emf)
* Windows  Metafile (*.wmf)



To insert a picture into your document, position the caret to the desired location and on the **Insert** [tab](../text-editor-ui/ribbon-interface.md), in the **Illustrations** group, click the **Picture** button.

The inserted picture has an **In Line with Text** wrapping style which you can [change](wrap-text-around-a-picture-or-text-box.md) later.

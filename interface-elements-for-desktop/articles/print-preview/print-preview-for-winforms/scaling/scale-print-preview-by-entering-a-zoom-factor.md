# Scale Print Preview by Entering a Zoom Factor
To scale a document, click the **Scale** ![previewButtonScale](../../../../images/Img7267.png) button on the toolbar. The **Scaling** dialog will be invoked.

Set the required percentage value in the editor.

Click **OK** to save changes and close the dialog.

> If you're working with a document [loaded from file](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/print-preview/print-preview-for-winforms/file-management/load-a-print-preview-from-a-file.md), you cannot use scaling.

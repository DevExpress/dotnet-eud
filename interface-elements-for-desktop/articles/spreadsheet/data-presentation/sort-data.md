# Sort Data

The **Spreadsheet** allows you to sort data by text (**A to Z** or **Z to A**), numbers (**smallest to largest** or **largest to smallest**), dates and times (**oldest to newest** or **newest to oldest**), and color in one column.

To sort data, do the following.

1. Select a range in the column you wish to sort.

2. On the **Data** tab, in the **Sort &amp; Filter** group, click **Sort A to Z** to select ascending order, or click **Sort Z to A** for descending order.

> If multiple columns are selected, the range is sorted by the **first** column.

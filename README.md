# DevExpress End-User Documentation

In addition to **developer documentation**, DevExpress also provides **end-user documentation** for its Desktop (Windows Forms & WPF) and ASP.NET products. This documentation contains information on individual user interface elements (such as grids, navigation panes, data editors, charts, etc.), and provides instructions for end-users about how to solve the most-common tasks with these interface elements.

The DevExpress end-user documentation is divided into four target platforms:

#### Desktop (WinForms & WPF):
* [Interface Elements for Desktop](interface-elements-for-desktop/articles/README.md)
* [Dashboard for Desktop](dashboard-for-desktop/articles/README.md)

#### Web (ASP.NET):
* [Interface Elements for Web](interface-elements-for-web/articles/README.md)
* [Dashboard for Web](dashboard-for-web/articles/README.md)

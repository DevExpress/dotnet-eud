# Expressions Panel

The **Expressions Panel** allows you to assign expressions to various element properties. The expressions are evaluated at runtime before a document is generated. The Report Designer displays this panel if **expression bindings** are enabled.

Click the ellipsis button next to a property editor to invoke the [Expression Editor](../expression-editor.md), that allows you to specify custom expressions.

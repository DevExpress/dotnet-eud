# Filter Data

The topics in this section describe different approaches to filtering data in your reports:

* [Filter Data at the Report Level](filter-data/filter-data-at-the-report-level.md)
    
    Use the report's settings demonstrated in this tutorial if you want to load the entire dataset and filter it on the client.

* [Filter Data at the Data Source Level](filter-data/filter-data-at-the-data-source-level.md)

    Filter records at data source level using your data connection query if you are binding to a large data source and want to speed up the retrieval process.

* [Limit the Number of Records to Display](filter-data/limit-the-number-of-records-to-display.md)

    Options described in this topic allow you to emulate the Top N feature in a sorted report or increase the Print Preview performance by rendering only a subset of a reportâ€™s data.

# Group Data by a Custom Field

This tutorial illustrates how to group a report against a custom criteria, in particular, group data by days of the week. 

1. Create a new or open an existing data-bound report.
	
	You cannot apply grouping unless your report is bound to a data source.

2. Create a [calculated field](../use-calculated-fields.md). Switch to the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) panel, select the data source or a table inside it and click **Add Calculated Field**.

3. Click the **Edit** button for the calculated field and then click the **Expression** property's ellipsis button. In the invoked [Expression Editor](../../report-designer-tools/expression-editor.md), select the required date-time function and define the data field's name in **[**square brackets**]**. For example,  use the **GetDayOfWeek([OrderDate])** function to return a zero-based index of the day of the week, extracted from the **OrderDate** data field.

	Click **OK** to close the editor and save the changes.
4. Insert the [Group Header](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band,      select the **Group Fields** section in the **Actions** category and add a      new group field to group the report's data by the calculated field.

	Click the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-ascending.png) or ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-descending.png) buttons to define the sort order within the group (ascending or descending). Use the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-disable-sorting.png) button to disable sorting in grouped data.

5. Switch to the **Field List** and drop the required data fields onto the report's area.

6. Select the label in the Group Header and set the **Text Format String** property to **{0:dddd}**. This makes the label only display the day of the week, and not the date.

Switch to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md) to see the result.

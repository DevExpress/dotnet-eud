# Sort Data by a Custom Field

This tutorial illustrates how to sort a report against a custom criteria, in particular, sort data by the number of characters in the data field value. 

1. Create a new or open an existing data-bound report.
	
	You cannot apply grouping unless your report is bound to a data source.

2. Create a [calculated field](../use-calculated-fields.md). Switch to the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) panel, select the data source or a table inside it and click **Add Calculated Field**.

3. Click the **Edit** button for the calculated field and then click the **Expression** property's ellipsis button. In the invoked [Expression Editor](../../report-designer-tools/expression-editor.md), select the required date-time function and define the data field's name in **[**square brackets**]**. For example,  use the **Len([ProductName])** function to return the number of characters extracted from the **ProductName** data field.

	Click **OK** to close the editor and save the changes.

4. Switch to the [Properties](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/properties-panel.md) panel and select the [Detail](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band. Select the **Sort Fields** section in the **Actions** category and add a new sort field to sort the report's data by the calculated field.

    Click the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-ascending.png) or ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-descending.png) buttons to define the sort order within the group (ascending or descending).
    Use the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-disable-sorting.png) button to disable sorting in grouped data.

6. Drag the corresponding field from the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) onto the report area and switch to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md) to see the result.

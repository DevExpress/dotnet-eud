    "keywords": "Coloring The Dashboard Designer allows you to paint dashboard item elements such as chart series points or pie segments. Supported Dashboard Items You can paint the following dashboard items: Chart Scatter Chart Pie Pie Map Range Filter Treemap Color Scheme Overview The dashboard supports two ways to color dashboard item elements: A Global Color Scheme uses consistent colors for identical values across the dashboard. The image below shows a dashboard that contains Pie and Chart dashboard items. Pie segments and chart series points that correspond to Wisconsin, Oregon and Idaho dimension values use identical colors from the default palette. For a global color scheme, the dashboard reserves automatically generated colors for specific values regardless of the filter state. A Local Color Scheme uses an independent set of colors for each dashboard item. The image below shows Pie segments that use colors from a local color scheme. These colors do not affect the Chart items that use a global scheme. For a Local color scheme, the dashboard reassigns palette colors when the filter state is changed. Tip Local colorization paints dashboard item elements more quickly because the control does not request all possible colors and requests only colors used in the current item. Color Measures and Dimensions You can use predefined color modes to paint individual dimensions or all measures in a dashboard item. The following color settings are available: Color Mode Option Description Default Enables or disables coloring depending on the dashboard item's type. For example, for TreeMap arguments and Chart series, Default means Hue. For Chart arguments, Default means None. Hue Elements use different colors. None Elements use the same color.

This topic describes how to configure color settings in the WinForms Designer. Coloring Basics The following concepts are common to both Desktop and Web Dashboard controls: Color Modes Color Schemes Supported Dashboard Items Refer to the following topic for more information about common concepts: Coloring Basics. Color Mode: None You can disable default color variation for dashboard item elements. If you add a TreeMap to a dashboard, individual elements (titles) use different colors: State values (Arguments) use different colors. To disable color variation, go to the Argument settings and select Color by | None. Add a Chart with the same Argument and Value as in the TreeMap: Note that Default means None for chart arguments. Color Mode: Hue You can enable colors in previously added Treemap and Chart items. Set the TreeMap's color mode to Default or Hue: In the Chart settings, move State from Arguments to Series. Default now means Hue in this new context. The coloring indicator () on the data item shows that color variation by hue is enabled. Add Category as a chart argument and switch to 100% Stacked View: Use Global Color Scheme The same State data items use identical colors. Dashboard constructs a Global Color Scheme for this purpose. Add a Range Filter with the following settings: Corresponding State fields are painted with the same colors, so you can associate and compare data from all dashboard items. This happens because all items use Global Colors (the default setting). You can see the switch to Global Colors in the Ribbon. Click Edit Colors to modify the colors used in the palette: Note The dashboard uses the default palette. This palette contains 20 unique colors to paint dimension values/measures. For more information on how to change default colors or create a new color table, refer to the following help topic: Customizing a Color Scheme. This is how the Dashboard appears after you change the color for Georgia in the palette: Use Local Color Scheme If you want to use an independent set of colors in the selected dashboard item, switch to the Local Color Scheme. You can see the Treemap's arguments that use colors from the Local Color Scheme: Colors modified in the local color scheme do not affect items that use the global color scheme. The following image shows a custom color for Georgia in the Treemap: Dashboard Item Color Mode Specifics Chart - Coloring Scatter Chart - Coloring Pie - Coloring Pie Map - Coloring Range Filter - Coloring Treemap - Coloring How to Customize a Color Scheme Refer to the following topic for more information on how to customize a color scheme: Customizing a Color Scheme"

You can select the required color from the default dashboard palette or specify a custom color. Invoke a Color Scheme Dialog Edit Colors Add a New Value Add a New Color Table Invoke a Color Scheme Dialog To edit colors, use the Color Scheme dialog. You can invoke this dialog in the following ways. To edit colors in a global color scheme, use the Edit Colors button in the Home ribbon tab or the Edit Colors button in the dashboard item's Design tab. To edit colors in a local color scheme, use the Edit Colors button in the contextual Design ribbon tab. Lets consider a Chart dashboard item whose dimensions and measures are colored by hue using local colors. For this dashboard item, the Color Scheme dialog will contain combinations of all dimension values and a specific measure. In this dialog, you can perform the following actions. Edit automatically assigned colors or specify new colors. Add new values to a color table. Add new color tables containing values whose colors are not yet assigned. Edit Colors You can customize automatically assigned colors in several ways. To retain the automatically assigned color for the selected value, right-click the required value in the Value column and select Retain this color. This reserves the current palette color for the selected value. You can select another palette color by clicking the required cell in the Color column. To specify a custom color, click More Colors... and pick any color using the RGB or HSB color model in the invoked Select Color dialog. You can reset the customized color for the selected value using the Reset menu item. Add a New Value The Color Scheme dialog allows you adding a new value with the specified color to the selected color table. To do this, click the New Value... button. In the invoked New Value dialog, specify the dimension values, add the required measures and click OK. This creates a new value whose color can be specified as described in Edit Colors. You can remove manually added values using the Remove context menu item. Add a New Color Table The Color Scheme dialog also allows you to add a new color table containing values whose colors are not yet assigned. To do this, click New Color Table... button. In the invoked dialog, specify the data source, add the required dimensions and enable the 'MeasureNames' Dimension check-box if you need to add measures to a color table.

    "keywords": "Automatic and Manual Updates When you perform a data-aware operation in the Dashboard Designer (for instance, change the binding of a specified dashboard item or apply filtering), the dashboard sends a query to a data source and updates itself automatically according to the returned data. If the dashboard is bound to a large data source, updating the dashboard according to each change can consume a significant amount of time. In this case, you can disable automatic updates and update the dashboard manually when needed. Automatic updates are enabled by default and can be managed using the Automatic Updates button in the Home ribbon tab. Click this button to disable automatic updates. In this case, the dashboard item will not be updated automatically according to each change. Imagine that you have a Grid dashboard item containing the dimension and measure columns. If you change the sort order of the Sales Person column or change the summary type of the Extended Price column, the Grid will be shaded and will display the icon within its caption. This indicates that this dashboard item requires the update to reflect changes. To update the Grid manually, click the Update button in the Home ribbon tab. Note that the state of the Automatic Updates option is saved to the dashboard XML definition but affects only the Dashboard Designer. Note Note that automatic updates are disabled if you click the Cancel button on the loading panel when performing a time-consuming operation."

    "keywords": "Bind Dashboard Items to Data This topic explains how to bind the newly created dashboard item to data source fields, to display data. Binding Concepts Create Binding Modify Binding Clear Binding Binding Concepts To bind dashboard items to data in the Dashboard Designer, the DATA ITEMS pane is used. Each dashboard item type has a specific set of data sections, such as Values, Arguments and Series in the chart, Columns and Sparklines in the grid, and Values, Columns and Rows in the pivot grid. Each data section corresponds to a particular dashboard item area or element, and should be mapped to data to be displayed within this area/element. Mapping is performed using data items - objects that are used to bind a dashboard item to data source fields. Data items are used to link the dashboard item to the required data source fields and, thus, visualize data within the dashboard item. Another key concept in data binding is the data item container, which represents a set of data items. It can contain either a single data item or multiple data items, and allows you to specify various options related to how a specific dashboard item visualizes data. The data item can process data in two ways - as dimensions or measures. This depends on the data section to which the data item is assigned, and the type of the data item container. dimension - a data item whose values are not intended to be summarized. These values can be of any type - string, date-time or numeric. In any case, the dashboard does not summarize the dimension values, but groups identical values. You can perform grouping, sorting, or display the top values for the dimension values. You can also customize data format settings for numeric and date-time values. To access the data shaping settings, use the data item's menu button. For instance, dimensions are used to provide data for the chart argument axis, pivot grid column and row headers. measure - a data item whose values are summarized before they are used in the dashboard. These values can be of any type - numeric, date-time or string. In any case, the dashboard will calculate an appropriate summary function against measure values. You can also customize the data format settings that affect how summary values are displayed. To access these settings, use the data item's menu button. For example, measures are used to provide data for the chart's Y-axis, and to calculate pivot cell values. Specific data sections display Options buttons for each data item container. Use these buttons to invoke a dialog that allows you to specify the settings of this data item container. These settings affect how a particular dashboard item's area/element displays the provided data. Create Binding The DATA ITEMS pane displays data sections of the selected dashboard item. It can be used to add, rearrange or remove data items. To bind a dashboard item to data, select the dashboard item. Then choose the required data field from the Data Source Browser and drop it onto the appropriate section in the DATA ITEMS pane. You can remove the data item by dragging it outside the DATA ITEMS pane. To learn how to bind a specific dashboard item to data, see the Providing Data topic for the required dashboard item. To rename the data item, click its menu button and select Rename, to invoke the Rename Data Item dialog. Modify Binding You can modify data binding by dragging data item containers within a data section. To do this, drag the data item container to the required position. You can also modify data binding by dragging data items within the DATA ITEMS pane. This action has the following specifics. If you drag the data item to a new position, the settings specified for the corresponding data item container will be restored to the default values. If you drag the data item to an existing data item placeholder, the settings of the corresponding data item container will be applied. Clear Binding To remove all data items for a selected dashboard item, use the Remove Data Items button in the Home ribbon tab. You can also do this via the dashboard item's context menu."

To create hidden data items, choose the required data field from the Data Source Browser and drop it onto the appropriate section in the HIDDEN DATA ITEMS area. You can perform the following operations using hidden data items. Filtering Sorting Top N Conditional Formatting Filtering You can use hidden dimensions to apply filtering to the dashboard item. To do this, select the required hidden dimension in the Filter Editor dialog and specify the required condition. For instance, the Grid on the image above is filtered by the first quarter of the OrderDate (Quarter) dimension. Sorting You can sort values of the specified dimension by the hidden measure. To do this, select the required measure from the dimension's Sort By sub-menu. For instance, categories displayed in the Grid on the image above are sorted by values of the hidden Quantity (Sum) measure. Top N You can use hidden measures in Top N conditions. To do this, select the required measure from the Measure combo box in the Top N Values dialog. For instance, the Grid on the image above displays top 5 categories for the Quantity (Sum) hidden measure. Conditional Formatting You can create format rules based on hidden measures to apply conditional formatting to elements corresponding to visible values. To do this, use the Add Format Rule menu of the hidden measure. For the Expression format condition, you can use the required hidden measure in the same manner as in the Filter Editor dialog."

Default Maps DevExpress Dashboard ships with a set of default maps showing various parts of the world. The following maps are included. World Countries - a world map. Europe - a map of Europe. Asia - a map of Asia. North America - a map of North America. South America - a map of South America. Africa - a map of Africa. USA - a map of the USA. Canada - a map of Canada. Note Note that the World Countries map has a lower level of detail than maps of specific regions and may not contain some countries. As an alternative, you can load a custom map with the required granularity. To select the required default map, use the Default Map button in the Open group of the Design ribbon tab. As an alternative, use the corresponding command in the map context menu. Custom Maps DevExpress Dashboard uses a Shapefile vector format to provide custom maps. Commonly, this format includes two file types. .shp file - holds map shapes (points/lines/polygons). .dbf file - contains attributes for each shape. To open an existing shapefile, use the Load Map or Import Map button in the Ribbon, or the command in the context menu (Load Map... or Import Map...). In the invoked dialog, locate the required .shp file. Note that custom maps created in the Cartesian coordinate system are not supported. Note If the map is opened using the Load Map button, the dashboard XML definition will contain the path to a map shapefile. If the map is opened using the Import Map button, the dashboard XML definition will contain the map itself. Note Attributes from the corresponding .dbf file located in the same directory will be included in the map automatically. Map Attributes After you select the default map or a custom map, you can view supplemental information (such as the name of the country, state, etc.). To do this, click the Options button next to the Attribute placeholder. In the invoked Map Attribute Binding dialog, click Preview. This table displays the available attributes for the current map. Each set of attribute values is related to a specific map shape. To learn how to bind the map attribute to a data source field, see the Providing Data topic."

Binary Array - Use this mode if images are stored in the data source as byte arrays. URI - Use this mode to locate images accessible by a predefined URI. In this case, the data source field should return strings that are parts of URIs to these images. For instance, the URI pattern in the form below specifies the path to the folder containing the required images. Data source field values will be inserted to the position of the {0} placeholder. Thus, the Bound Image maps the current dimension value with the image placed at the specified URI. Note Note that the Bound Image can display only a single image simultaneously.

    "keywords": "Dashboard Items Layout The Dashboard Designer provides the capability to arrange and resize dashboard items and groups in various ways, using simple drag-and-drop operations. Layout Concepts Item Resizing Maximize and Restore Item Item Positioning Layout Concepts The dashboard arranges dashboard items and groups using layout items and layout groups. They are special containers that are used to present a dashboard layout as a hierarchical structure. A layout item is used as a container that displays an individual dashboard item. A layout group is used as a container that is used to arrange layout items (or other layout groups) either horizontally or vertically. At the same time, layout groups are used as containers that display dashboard item groups. Thus, a dashboard layout is hierarchically arranged from the root layout group to bottommost layout items, which display individual dashboard items. Item Resizing You can resize individual items/groups of items by dragging their edges. By default, a 2x2 layout group of dashboard items is horizontally oriented and contains two child layout groups. This arranges dashboard items in two 'columns' and allows you to set a different height for items in different columns. You can switch the orientation of the 2x2 group to Vertical using the indicator at the group intersection. This allows you to specify different widths for dashboard items in different 'rows'. The table below lists and describes different modes. Indicator Result Description Orients the layout group horizontally and allows you to change the height of individual items and the width of 'columns'. Orients the layout group vertically and allows you to change the width of individual items and the height of 'rows'. Maximize and Restore Item You can expand any dashboard item into the whole dashboard size to examine data in greater detail. The expanded dashboard item size in this case is the same as the root layout group. To maximize a dashboard item, click the Maximize button in the dashboard item caption. To restore the item size, click Restore. Item Positioning You can change the position of a dashboard item by using drag-and-drop and one of the following approaches. If the caption of the dashboard item is visible, click it and hold down the left mouse button while dragging the item. If the caption of the dashboard item is not visible, click the icon in the top left corner, and hold down the left mouse button while dragging the item. Depending on the required dashboard item position, a new layout group is created (if required) to maintain the arrangement of items. Thus, the dashboard item can be inserted to the desired area of a new or existing dashboard layout group. The following table illustrates how a dashboard item is dragged. Action Description Select the required dashboard item. Drag the dashboard item to the expected area. The drag indicator ( ) will show possible positions for the dashboard item. Move the mouse cursor to the required position. The drop indicator ( ) highlights the hovered position. Then, the drop indicator sequentially displays areas that can be occupied by the dashboard item. Release the left mouse button when the drop indicator displays the required area. The dashboard item is moved to a new position."

    "title": "Intermediate Level Aggregations | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Intermediate Level Aggregations The Dashboard can aggregate and summarize data on different levels. The Query Builder allows you to prepare an underlying data source before analyzing data. You can apply grouping, sorting, summarization and other data shaping operations during data selection. Dashboard items aggregate and summarize data at a visualization level using dimensions and measures, respectively. To learn more, see Bind Dashboard Items to Data. The Aggr function allows you to introduce an intermediate detail level that is not related to the visualization level. This allows you to create custom aggregations at different levels and combine these aggregations with existing visualizations. Overview The Aggr function aggregates and summarizes underlying data using the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function. This function can be used during the creation of a new calculated field in the Expression Editor. The Aggr function has the following syntax. Aggr(summaryExpression, dimension1, dimension2, ...) The first argument is a summary expression calculated against a specific data source field. The next arguments are the set of dimensions whose values are aggregated and used to calculate summaries specified using the first argument. For instance, the following function calculates sums of sales for each product within the specified category. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) If you created the calculated field that includes the Aggr function and dropped the created field into an existing dashboard item, the Dashboard joins the resulting aggregation with the already displayed data. This means that you can add data with the increased or decreased granularity to the dashboard item. There are two main scenarios. In the first scenario, an aggregation has a less detailed granularity than visualized data. In this scenario, an underlying data source contains the list of orders for two categories and corresponding products. To aggregate this data by individual categories, create a calculated field with the following expression. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category]) The following internal table will be generated for this calculated field. The sample Grid dashboard item contains more detailed data and includes the following columns: Category, Product and the sum of Sales. If you drop the created calculated field to the Grid, the sum of sales for each category will be repeated for each Grid row. For instance, you can use these values later to calculate a contribution of each product to a category’s sales. An aggregation has a more detailed granularity than visualized data. To aggregate this data by categories and products, create a calculated field with the following expression. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) The following internal table will be generated for this calculated field. Drop the created calculated field to the Grid and set its summary type to Min. The Grid will display minimum product sales within each category. Example 1 - Best/Worst Sales by Year The following example shows how to display best and worst monthly sales for each year. In this example, the Chart dashboard item shows the sum of sales by different years. The Sales field is placed in the Values section and the OrderDate (with the Year group interval) is placed in the Arguments section. To display sales by the best/worst months for each year, create a new calculated field with the following expression. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), GetYear([OrderDate]), GetMonth([OrderDate])) Drop this field (Sales by Year/Month in the image below) to the Values section and set its summary type to Max. Then, drop this field to Values again and set its summary type to Min. The Chart will visualize sales by the best/worst months in a year. Example 2 - Percent of Total This example will demonstrate how to calculate a contribution of individual quarter sales to year sales. In this example, the Pivot dashboard item displays the sum of sales by year/quarter. The Sales field is placed in the Values section and the hierarchy of OrderDate fields (with the Year and Quarter group intervals) is placed in Rows. To calculate a contribution of each quarter to a year sales, do the following. Calculate totals for each year using the Aggr function by creating the following calculated field. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), GetYear([OrderDate])) Set the name of the created field to Sales by Year. Calculate a contribution of each quarter to year sales by creating the following calculated field. Sum([Sales]) / Max([Sales by Year]) Name this field Percent of Total and drop it to Values to see the result. Example 3 - Customer Acquisition In this example, a customer acquisition will be evaluated by grouping customers by the quarter/year of their first purchase to compare sales contributions. The Chart dashboard item below visualizes sales by quarter/year. The following expression determines the minimum order date (the first purchase date) per customer. Aggr(Min(GetDateQuarterYear([OrderDate])), [CustomerID]) Set the name of the created field to Customer First Order and drop this field to the Series section to see the result. Example 4 - Customer Order Count In this example, you will learn how to divide customers count by the number of orders they made. The Chart below shows the number of orders that is made by each customer. The calculated field below evaluates the number of unique orders made by each customer. Aggr(CountDistinct([OrderID]), [CustomerID]) Set the name of this field to Customer Order Count and drop this field to arguments. Then, drop the CustomerID field to Values and change its summary type to Count Distinct. The Chart will show the number of customers that made a specific number of orders. Example 5 - Best Product Sales by Year This scenario requires the use of nested aggregations. In this example, the dashboard will show products with the best sales in a year along with sales values. The initial Grid dashboard item shows sales of all products by year (the OrderDate column with the Year group interval and the Sales column). The data source also contains the ProductName field. To implement this scenario, perform the following steps. Create the calculated field that will return product sales for individual years. Aggr(Sum([Sales]), GetYear([OrderDate]), [ProductName]) Set its name to Product Sales by Year. Create the calculated field that will return maximum sales values. Aggr(Max([Product Sales by Year]), GetYear([OrderDate])) Set its name to Max Product Sales by Year. Finally, create a calculated field returning the name of the product with the best sales and a corresponding sales value. Iif([Max Product Sales by Year] = [Product Sales by Year], [ProductName] + ' ($ ' + [Product Sales by Year] + ')', null) Specify the name as Best Sales Product. Then, drop this field to the Columns section to see the result."

In the Dashboard Designer, you can use the following set of predefined aggregate functions: Function Description Aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) Aggregates underlying data using the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function. For more information, see Intermediate Level Aggregations. Avg(Value) Returns the average of all the values in the expression. Count() Returns the number of values. CountDistinct(Value) Returns the number of distinct values. Max(Value) Returns the maximum value across all records. Min(Value) Returns the minimum value across all records. Median(Value) Returns the median of the values. Sum(Value) Returns the sum of all values. Var(Value) Returns an estimate of the variance of a population where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Varp(Value) Returns the variance of a population where the population is the entire data to be summarized. StdDev(Value) Returns an estimate of the standard deviation of a population where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StdDevp(Value) Returns the standard deviation of a population where the population is the entire data to be summarized. These functions can be used for all types of numeric fields. After creating such calculated fields, you can use them as measures in an OLAP cube. Custom Aggregate Functions Along with the predefined aggregations (like Min, Max, Sum, Avg), the Dashboard supports custom aggregation functions. A custom aggregate function appears in the Expression Editor's categories if the function was registered in your application. The following image illustrates the custom StringConcat function in the Aggregate function’s category: Names of custom aggregate functions are stored in the Custom Aggregate Names category and can be used as arguments when you create window calculations as WindowAggregate and RunningAggregate.

    "keywords": "Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions The DevExpress Dashboard uses criteria language that you can use in various DevExpress products for building expressions. An expression is a string that evaluates some value. The criteria language is based on the the cross-platform library with some additions and subtractions specific for dashboards. This topic details basic and dashboard-specific constants, operators, and functions. The tables below contain constants, operators, and functions you can use in dashboard expressions. Constants Constant Description Example String constants Wrap string constants in apostrophes. If a string contains an apostrophe, double the apostrophe. [Country] == 'France' or [Name] == 'O''Neil' Date-time constants Wrap date-time constants in '#'. [OrderDate] >= #2018-03-22 13:18:51.94944# True Represents the Boolean True value. [InStock] == True False Represents the Boolean False value. [InStock] == False Enumeration Specify an enumeration value using its underlying integer value. Note that you cannot specify an enumeration value using its qualified name. [Status] == 1 Guid Wrap a Guid constant in curly braces. Use Guid constants in a relational operation with equality or inequality operators only. [OrderID] == {513724e5-17b7-4ec6-abc4-0eae12c72c1f} Numeric Specify different numeric constant types in a string form using suffixes: Int32 (int) - 1, Int16 (short) - 1s, Byte (byte) - 1b, Double (double) - 1.0, Single (float) - 1.0f, Decimal (decimal) - 1.0m, [Price] == 25.0m ? Represents a null reference that does not refer to any object. We recommend using the IsNull unary operator (for example, \"[Region] is null\") or the IsNull logical function (for example, \"IsNull([Region])\") instead. [Region] != ? You can build parameterized criteria using any number of positional parameters. To do this, add parameter placeholders (question mark characters) to a criteria expression to identify parameter positions and provide a list of parameter values. When building criteria, parameter placeholders are substituted with parameter values in values in the order they are listed. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Name] == ? and [Age] == ?\", \"John\", 33) The following two examples are identical, but the second one allows you to avoid formatting errors. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#\") CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= ?\", new DateTime(2009, 1, 1)) When parameters are not specified, a parameter placeholder is substituted with null. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Region] != ?\") Operators Operator Description Example + Adds the value of one numeric expression to another or concatenates two strings. [UnitPrice] + 4 or [FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName] - Finds the difference between two numbers. [Price1] - [Price2] * Multiplies the value of two expressions. [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] * (1 - [BonusAmount]) / Divides the first operand by the second. [Quantity] / 2 % Returns the remainder (modulus) obtained by dividing one numeric expression by another. [Quantity] % 3 | Performs a bitwise inclusive OR on two numeric expressions. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag1] [Flag2] & The bitwise AND operator. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag] & 10 ^ Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on two numeric expressions. [Flag1] ^ [Flag2] == Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] == 10 = Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] = 10 != Returns true if the operands do not have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Country] != 'France' < Less than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] < 20 <= Less than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] <= 20 >= Greater than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] >= 30 > Greater than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] > 30 In (,,,) Tests for the existence of a property in an object. [Country] In ('USA', 'UK', 'Italy') Between (,) Specifies a range to test. Returns true if a value is greater than or equal to the first operand and less than or equal to the second operand. [Quantity] Between (10, 20) And Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] And ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) && Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] && ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) Or Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' Or [Country]=='UK' | Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' | [Country]=='UK' ~ Performs a bitwise negation on a numeric expression. ~[Roles] = 251 Not Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. Not [InStock] ! Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. ![InStock] + Returns a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). +[Value] = 10 - Returns the negative of a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). -[Value] = 20 Is Null Returns true if an expression is a null reference, the one that does not refer to any object. [Region] is null Functions Advanced Functions - Intermediate Aggregation Level Function Description Example aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) Uses the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function to aggregate underlying data. aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) w(WindowExpression, partitionByFunction, orderByFunction) Calculates aggregated values with the specified window function for the window defined by the specified partitioning and ordering. w(RankDense(Sum([ProductSales]), 'desc'), partitionBy([CategoryName]), orderBy()) partitionBy(column1, column2, ...)

For instance, the operators are performed in a default order in the first of the following two code samples. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Amount == 2 + 48 * 2 Amount == (2 + 48) * 2 Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Although field values’ case sensitivity depends on the data source. Note A data source affects certain operators' behavior. For instance, by default, the SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with an escape character (@ sign). In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as the field named \"Or\", not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash () as an escape character for characters in expressions. Examples: \\[ \\\\ \\'"

Creating Parameters in the Dashboard Designer Look-Up Editor Settings Creating Parameters in the Dashboard Designer To create dashboard parameters in the Dashboard Designer, do the following: Click the Parameters button on the Ribbon's Data Source tab. In the invoked dialog, click the Add button to add a new parameter. Specify the following settings. Visible - Specifies whether or not the parameter editor is visible in the Dashboard Parameters dialog. Allow Null - Specifies whether or a not null value can be passed as a parameter value. Allow Multiselect - Specifies whether or not multi-selection is enabled for the current parameter. The following limitations are applied to parameters with multi-selection enabled. Use the is any of or is none of operators to pass a multi-select parameter to a filter criteria or to the Expression format condition. Use the In or Not In operators to pass a multi-select parameter to a calculated field expression. Stored procedures used in the SQL data source do not support multi-select parameters. Name - Specifies the parameter name. When creating and modifying parameter names, follow the rules below. A name can contain letters, numbers and underscores. A name cannot contain spaces. A name cannot be an empty string. The dashboard cannot contain parameters with the same name. Names are case-sensitive. For example, you can create the names Parameter and PARAMETER . Description - Specifies the parameter's description. The parameter's description is the value displayed in the Parameter Name column of the Dashboard Parameters dialog. Look-Up Settings - Specifies the parameter's look-up editor settings. Select All Values - Specifies whether or not all parameter values should be selected in the initial state of the Dashboard Viewer. Note that this option is in effect when Allow Multiselect is set to true. Type - Specifies the parameter type. Value - Specifies the default parameter’s value. Note that when Allow Multiselect is set to true, the Value option allows you to select multiple parameter values. Then, click OK to add the created parameters to the dashboard. Look-Up Editor Settings There are three types of look-up editor settings that can be specified for a parameter. Select the required type from the LookUpSettings drop-down list. No Look-Up - set the Value to use a static value as a parameter. Static List - click the ellipsis button to add static values for the current dashboard parameter. In this case, the Value specifies the default parameter's value. Dynamic List - allows you to use a list of values from the existing data source as a parameter. You need to select the required Data Source from the list of available data sources and data members for the dashboard parameter's display name and value, respectively. First, select the required Data Source from the list of available data sources. For the SQL data source, select the required Data Member that specifies the query from the selected Data Source. Then, specify data members for the dashboard parameter's value and display name using Value Member and Display Member, respectively. If necessary, specify the data member used to sort parameter values using the Sort By option. Sort Order specifies the required sort order. Note To learn how to create a data source for a dashboard parameter, see Provide Data. Note that you cannot specify an OLAP data source as the data source for the dashboard parameter in the Dashboard Designer."

SQL Queries Filtering Conditional Formatting Calculated Fields Window Calculations SQL Queries The Dashboard Designer provides the capability to use a dashboard parameter as an SQL query/stored procedure parameter. To pass a dashboard parameter to an SQL query/stored procedure in the Data Source wizard or Query Editor, do the following. Create a query parameter or select the required stored procedure parameter. Enable the Expression checkbox for this parameter and select the required dashboard parameter in the Value column. If necessary, you can select Expression editor... and specify an expression to bind a query parameter to a dashboard parameter using custom logic. Filtering You can filter the specified query of the SQL Data Source or apply filtering to a specific dashboard item according to the current parameter value(s) using the Filter Editor. In the Filter Editor, you can compare a field value with the following objects. A static value (represented by the icon). Click this button to switch to the next item mode (\"another field value\"), to compare the field value with another field value. Another field value (represented by the icon). Click this button to switch to the next item mode (“parameter value”), to compare the field value with a parameter value. A parameter value (represented by the icon). Click this button to switch back to the initial mode (\"static value\"), to compare the field value with a static value. Thus, to compare a field value with a parameter value, click the button, then click the button. Conditional Formatting You can apply conditional formatting to a specific dashboard item according to the current parameter value when creating the Expression format condition. In the Expression dialog, you can compare a field value with parameter values in the same manner as in the Filter Editor dialog. Calculated Fields You can use parameters when constructing expressions for calculated fields. This allows you to dynamically evaluate values of the calculated field depending on the current parameter value. To include the required parameter in the calculated field expression, click Parameters in the Expression Editor dialog and double-click the required parameter. Window Calculations You can use parameters when customizing expressions for window calculations. This allows you to apply a calculation dynamically, depending on the current parameter value."

    "keywords": "Window Calculations Overview Window calculations provide the capability to apply specific computations to measure values and allow you to perform different analytical tasks such as to compute running totals, percentages of totals, differences, etc. The Dashboard Designer allows you to apply window calculations to values of the specified measure. The following calculation types are supported. Running Total - Allows you to calculate a cumulative total for a set of measure values. Moving Calculation - Allows you to apply a moving calculation, which uses neighboring values to calculate a total. Note that neighboring values are specified using offsets from the currently processed value. Difference - Allows you to compute differences between measure values. Percent of Total - Allows you to calculate a contribution of individual measure values to a total. Rank - Allows you to rank values of the specified measure. Note that the computing of calculations depends on two factors. The type of the dashboard item. In this case, you need to specify a calculation direction that depends on the dashboard item type. For instance, the Pivot dashboard item provides the capability to apply calculations along with its columns or rows. The set of dimensions that are used to calculate measure values. In this case, a calculation direction depends on the dimensions' order. In both cases, measure values participating in a calculation fall into a specified window.

Dimensions and hidden dimensions are used to build filter criteria. Dashboard Item Filter Filters that apply to a dashboard item affect only this item. To add filters, select the target dashboard item and do one of the following: Click the Edit Filter button in the Ribbon menu's Data tab. Right-click a dashboard item and select Edit Filter from its context menu. This invokes the Filter Editor dialog that allows you to build complex filter criteria: Tip Documentation: Filter Editor To clear the applied filter, select Clear from the dashboard item's context menu or click the Clear button in the Data Ribbon tab. Measure Filter You can apply filters to individual measures. If you create multiple measures that only differ in applied filters, you can compare values calculated over different date-time periods or against different categories. Select a dashboard item and right-click a measure to be filtered. Select Edit Filter from its context menu. This invokes the Filter Editor dialog where you can specify filter criteria: The filtered measure has the Filter icon: To clear the applied filter, select Clear from the measure's context menu. Note The measure filter is technically an expression that uses the filter(summaryExpression, filterCriteria) function, where summaryExpression is the measure to be filtered and filterCriteria is the filter. See the following topic for more information about functions you can use in dashboard expressions: Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions. The image below shows a Chart with three measures: 2019 - Opened is filtered by year 2019. 2020 - Opened is filtered by year 2020. Opened is the original measure without filters. Visible Data Filter You can specify a Visible Data Filter to limit displayed data. This filter type does not filter underlying data used in calculations or intermediate level aggregations. Click the Set Visible Data Filter button in the Ribbon menu's Data tab to invoke the Visible Data Filter Editor, where you can set a filter condition: For example, a Grid dashboard item has 35 rows and displays sales percentages. The image below shows the difference between filters (the filter condition is the same): Dashboard Item Filter: sales percentages are recalculated based on the visible data. Visible Data Filter: sales percentages remain the same because this filter type does not affect calculations. Pass Parameter Values You can use the Filter Editor to filter a dashboard item according to the current parameter value. See the following topic for details: Pass Parameter Values. OLAP Filtering Specifics You cannot filter data by building complex filter criteria in OLAP mode. Instead, select the values you wish to include in or exclude from the dashboard to filter dimension attributes and hierarchies.

Data visualization dashboard items allow you to enable master filtering by specifying the selection mode. The following dashboard items allow you to manage their master filtering mode. Chart Scatter Chart Grid Pies Cards Gauges Choropleth Map Geo Point Maps Treemap To learn how to manage master filtering for these items, see Master Filter Settings. Filter elements represent a special type of dashboard item whose main purpose is to apply filtering to other dashboard items. This capability is always enabled for these dashboard items. The following filter elements are available. Combo Box List Box Tree View Instead of switching between standard master filtering modes, some filter elements allow you to switch their type. This allows you to select a single value or multiple values. To learn more, see the Filter Elements section. Range Filter is a special type of dashboard item that displays a chart with selection thumbs and allows you to filter out values displayed along the argument axis. To learn more, see the Range Filter section. Dashboard item group allows you to manage interaction between dashboard items in and out of the group. To learn more about the interactivity capabilities of the dashboard item group, see the Interactivity paragraph in the Dashboard Item Group topic. Master Filter Settings Master Filtering Modes The Master Filter item supports two selection modes. Multiple - Allows you to select multiple elements in the Master Filter item. Single - Allows you to select only one element in the Master Filter item. When this mode is enabled, the default selection will be set to a Master Filter element. You can change this selection, but cannot clear it. To enable/disable master filtering, use the Multiple Master Filter or Single Master Filter buttons in the Data Ribbon tab. Note If the selected dashboard item contains several types of elements that can be used for filtering, the Ribbon or Toolbar will provide the appropriate buttons to switch between these types (e.g., the Arguments and Series buttons in the Chart). For details, refer to the documentation for individual dashboard items in the Dashboard Item Settings section. Filtering Across Data Sources When different items in a dashboard are bound to different data sources, you can specify that a particular Master Filter should be applied across data sources. This means that it will apply filtering to fields with matching names in all data sources. Fields are matched by their full names. For fields in other data sources to be affected by Master Filtering, their names must match the name of the field in the current data source, and they must belong to the same hierarchy level so that their full names also match. For instance, Customer.City and Customer.Address.City will not be treated as matching fields. To enable filtering across data sources, use the Cross-Data-Source Filtering button in the Data Ribbon tab. Preventing Items from Being Filtered You can prevent specific dashboard items from being affected by Master Filters. To do this, use the Ignore Master Filters button in the Data Ribbon tab.

    "title": "Neutral Filter Mode | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Neutral Filter Mode The filter elements show all items selected by default, to indicate that no filtering is currently taking place. Starting from this state, users typically begin each filtering operation by deselecting All, before they select individual items. An extra click is required to begin any actual filtering operation, because the standard filter mode shows all items selected. This is not an optimal implementation for performance reasons, because it generates filtering criteria that are evaluated by the data layer and/or the database. The dashboard in the image below illustrates how the filter elements are initialized in standard filter mode. To solve these issues, the Neutral Filter Mode is implemented. It is neutral in the sense that it does not apply any criteria to the data source in its default state, resulting in improved performance. All items are shown deselected. This means that an extra click is no longer required in the most common scenarios, and this behavior is familiar to end users from websites world-wide. Built-in UI does not provide a command to switch the filter mode. Reload a dashboard after switching the mode. The Neutral Filter Mode helps in a situation when there is a potential “dead lock”, due to the fact that multiple filter elements influence each other. The Clear Master Filter button resets the filters."

    "keywords": "Data Processing Modes DevExpress Dashboard supports two data processing modes that are used to perform data-related operations (such as grouping, filtering, etc.). In server mode, data-related operations are performed on the database server side. For instance, when you apply filtering to a dashboard item, the Dashboard Designer requests the required data automatically by sending a query containing a corresponding SELECT statement with the specified WHERE clause. In client mode, data-related operations are performed on the workstation side. In this mode, a compressed snapshot of aggregated data is loaded into a workstation memory. This reduces memory consumption and improves the speed of client-side data shaping operations using several techniques: data compression, various data grouping and multi-threading algorithms, etc. Tip Note that performance in server/client modes depends on multiple factors such as database structure, server workload, etc. To decide which mode to use, test both. Note In OLAP mode, data processing is performed using the server mode specified for the Analysis Services instance. To learn more, see Determine the Server Mode of an Analysis Services Instance. Change Data Processing Mode Different data source types allow you to manage the current data processing mode in different ways. For SQL data sources, you can switch between data processing modes manually. To enable or disable server mode for the selected data source, use the Server Mode button located on the Data Source ribbon tab. Server mode is supported for the SQL data sources created using the Data Source wizard and supplied with data using the Query Builder. Excel Data Source supports client mode only. Extract Data Source works in client mode. Server Mode Limitations In server mode, the Dashboard does not have simultaneous access to bound data in its entirety. This imposes some limitations. Stored procedures are not supported in server mode. Stored procedures executed using custom SQL are not supported in server mode. Some calculated fields cannot be evaluated in server mode. The Count Distinct summary function is not supported for the following database engines: Microsoft Access Microsoft SQL Server CE The Median summary function is supported for the Oracle data provider only. The Bound Image and Grid dashboard items cannot display images from the following types of databases: Microsoft SQL Server MySQL PostgreSQL Data Processing Errors The Dashboard Designer provides the capability to display errors that occurred during data processing operations (such as changing measure summary types, calculation errors, etc.).

XPO Data Source The XPO data source gets data from eXpress Persistent Objects. To create an XPO data source and specify connection parameters, see Binding to XPO Data Sources. Extract Data Source Extract Data Source is a compressed snapshot of data from a regular data source. This data is saved to a local file and can be updated from the original data source at any time. The extract data file is optimized for data grouping. It reduces the initial dashboard load time. A special in-memory cache allows you to improve performance when accessing extract data. To create an Extract data source and specify connection parameters, see Binding to Extract Data Sources. Object Data Source The Dashboard Designer allows you to connect to an object data source defined in a separate class within the current project. To create a connection to an Object data source, see Binding to Object Data Sources. Entity Framework Data Source Use the available data context to connect to EF data source. To create a connection to an EF data source, see Connect to EF Data Sources. Federated Data Source A federated data source integrates different data sources and provides uniform data access with a federated query. Federated data source supports the following data source types: SQL Data Source Excel Data Source Object Data Source MongoDB See the following topic for information on how to create a federated data source with the Data Source Wizard: Binding to Federated Data Source. MongoDB The Dashboard Designer allows you to connect to a MongoDB instance and stores data in JSON-like documents. The MongoDB.Driver package should be installed in your project to supply MongoDB data at runtime. You can use MongoDB as the original data source to create an Extract database. MongoDB can be used to create a federated data source. You can filter the MongoDB data source and add calculated fields.

The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a particular visual representation of data. The Chart dashboard item includes the following series types. A Bar series displays data as sets of rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. Point and Line series display data as standalone points or points joined by a line. An Area series displays data by a line that joins points, and the shaded area between the line and the argument axis. A Range series is the area between two simple series displayed as a shaded area, or bars that stretch from a point in one series to the corresponding point in another series. A Weighted series displays data using a third dimension, expressed by a bubble's size. Financial series are useful in analyzing stock and bond prices, as well as the behavior of commodities.

    "keywords": "Neutral Filter Mode The filter elements show all items selected by default, to indicate that no filtering is currently taking place. Starting from this state, users typically begin each filtering operation by deselecting All, before they select individual items. An extra click is required to begin any actual filtering operation, because the standard filter mode shows all items selected. This is not an optimal implementation for performance reasons, because it generates filtering criteria that are evaluated by the data layer and/or the database. To solve these issues, the Neutral Filter Mode is implemented. It is neutral in the sense that it does not apply any criteria to the data source in its default state, resulting in improved performance. All items are shown deselected. This means that an extra click is no longer required in the most common scenarios, and this behavior is familiar to end users from websites world-wide. Built-in UI does not provide a command to switch the filter mode. Reload a dashboard after switching the mode. The Neutral Filter Mode helps in a situation when there is a potential “dead lock”, due to the fact that multiple filter elements influence each other. The Clear Master Filter button resets the filters."

    "keywords": "Data Presentation Basics The Grid displays data in a two-dimensional table that supports four types of columns. The dimension column displays values from the bound data item \"as is\". The measure column displays summaries calculated from data in the bound data item. The delta column, bound to two measures, calculates summaries for both measures, and displays the difference between these summaries. The sparkline column visualizes the variation of summary values over time. Sort Grid Rows To sort records by a column's values and replace existing sort conditions that are applied to the current or other columns, click the target column's header until an Up or Down arrow icon is displayed within the header. The Up and Down arrows indicate ascending and descending sort orders, respectively. To sort records by a column's values while preserving existing sort conditions, click a column header while holding the SHIFT key until an Up or Down arrow icon is displayed within the header. To remove sorting by a column, click a column header while holding down the CTRL key. Filter Grid Data To filter grid data, click the filter button (the icon) and select the required filter value in the invoked filter dropdown list. Click Custom to construct filter criteria involving up to two conditions. This will invoke the Custom AutoFilter dialog, allowing you to compare a column with one or two values. To clear the filter applied to a specific column, invoke the filter dropdown list and click All. To clear all filter criteria, click the Close Filter button within the Filter Panel. Tooltips A Grid dashboard item can display a tooltip when the mouse pointer is hovered over the bar in the measure column. The tooltip shows the value in the measure column as text. When the mouse pointer is hovered over the cell in the sparkline column, the tooltip can display start/end values and minimum/maximum values."

Supported Dashboard Items You can manage coloring for the following dashboard items. Chart Scatter Chart Pie Pie Map Range Filter Treemap Color Schemes Overview The dashboard supports two ways to color dashboard item elements: Global color scheme. This scheme uses consistent colors for identical values across the dashboard. The image below shows a dashboard that contains Pie and Chart dashboard items. Pie segments and chart series points that correspond to Wisconsin, Oregon and Idaho dimension values use identical colors from the default palette. For a global color scheme, the dashboard reserves automatically generated colors for specific values regardless of the filter state. Local color scheme. This scheme uses an independent set of colors for each dashboard item. The image below shows Pie segments that use colors from a local color scheme. These colors do not affect the Chart item that uses a global scheme. For a Local color scheme, the dashboard reassigns palette colors when the filter state is changed. Color Measures and Dimensions You can configure color modes as follows: A specific data item - To specify the color mode for a specific measure/dimension, open the data item menu and go to the Data Shaping section. Use the Coloring option to specify the color mode of this data item. All data items - To see a list of all measures/dimensions for which you can specify color mode in a dashboard item, open the dashboard item's Options menu and go to the Coloring section. For example, the image below shows the Chart dashboard item whose Country dimension is colored by different hues: And the following Pie dashboard item colors measures by different hues: Note If you enable color variation by different hues for several dimensions/measures, all combinations of dimension values/measures are colored with different colors from the default palette. Customizing Color Palettes Using the Dashboard Item Menu The Web Dashboard allows you to customize colors of the specific palette using the Color Scheme section of the dashboard item Options menu. To edit the color scheme, click the Edit button (the icon) of the corresponding color. Then, pick any color using the RGB color model in the invoked color picker and click Confirm to change the color. A new color scheme will be applied to the dashboard item(s). Dashboard Item Color Mode Specifics The following table describes how colors are applied based on the dashboard item's type. Item's Name Coloring Specifics Chart The Chart colors different measures and series dimensions by hue. Scatter Chart The Scatter Chart does not color its arguments. Pies If the Pie dashboard item contains measures (the Values section) and series dimensions (the Series section), only values that correspond to different measures are colored by hue. If the Pie dashboard item contains arguments (the Arguments section), different argument values are colored by hue. Choropleth Map The Choropleth Map automatically selects palette and scale settings to color map shapes. Bubble Map The Bubble Map automatically selects palette and scale settings used to color bubbles depending on the provided values. Pie Map The Pie Map allows you to color segments that correspond to various dimension values/measures. Range Filter The Range Filter colors different measures and series dimensions by hue. Treemap If the Treemap contains only measures (the Values section), values that correspond to different measures are colored by different hues. If the Treemap contains arguments (the Arguments section), values that correspond to the first argument are colored by different hues. To change the default coloring behavior, you can configure color modes. Conditional Formatting The DevExpress Dashboard allows you to format dashboard item elements whose values meet a specified condition. This feature highlights specific elements with a predefined set of rules. Refer to the following article for more information about conditional formatting: Conditional Formatting. Switch between Global and Local Color Schemes The dashboard supports two ways to color dashboard item elements: A Global Color Scheme uses consistent colors for identical values across the dashboard. A Local Color Scheme uses an independent set of colors for each dashboard item. To switch between global and local color schemes in the Web Dashboard, open the dashboard item's Option menu, go to the Color Scheme section, and select the Color Scheme type. Tip The local color scheme paints dashboard item elements more quickly because the control does not request all possible colors and requests only colors used in the current item. Customize Color Palettes in the Dashboard Item Menu Use the Color Scheme section of the dashboard item Option menu to customize colors of the specific palette. To edit the color scheme, click the Edit button of the corresponding color. Then, pick any color in the RGB color model of the invoked color picker and click Confirm to change the color. A new color scheme is applied to the dashboard item(s). Customize Color Palettes in the Color Scheme Page The Color Scheme page of the dashboard menu allows you to edit and add colors to customize color tables. Edit Colors You can reassign a color in the selected color table. For this, select one of the available schemes in the Color Schemes pane and click the color in the Colors pane to invoke the Color combo box. If you click the Color dropdown button, it invokes a color picker where you can specify a new color. Click OK to change the automatically assigned color for the selected value and update the current color scheme. Add Colors The Color Scheme page allows you to add a new value with the specified color to the selected color scheme. To do this, use the Add color button. Specify the dimension value of the added color or select the measures. This creates a new value whose color can be specified as described in the Edit colors section. Hover over the custom color and click Remove (the icon) to remove the color."

To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the Master Filtering topic. The Chart supports filtering by argument, series or points. Filtering by arguments allows you to make other dashboard items display only data related to selected argument values by clicking series points. When filtering by series is enabled, you can click a series point to make other dashboard items display only data related to the selected series. Filtering by points makes other dashboard items display only data related to the selected point. To configure filtering type, open the Chart's Interactivity menu and select Arguments, Series or Points as a target dimension. To reset filtering, use the Clear Master Filter button (the icon) in the Chart's caption. Drill-Down The drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in the Chart dashboard item. To learn more about drill-down concepts common to all dashboard items, see the Drill-Down topic. The Chart supports drill-down on argument or series values. To drill down on arguments, click a series point to view a detail chart for the corresponding argument value. Drill-down on arguments requires that the Arguments section contains several data items, from the least detailed to the most detailed item. When drill-down on series is enabled, you can click a series point to view a detail chart for the corresponding series. Drill-down on series requires that the Series section contains several data items, from the least detailed to the most detailed item. Note In OLAP mode, you can perform drill-down for either a hierarchy data item or several dimension attributes. To specify drill-down type, go to the Chart's Interactivity menu and set Arguments or Series as a target dimension. To return to the previous detail level, click the Drill Up button (the icon) in the Chart's caption."

A layout group is used as a container that is used to arrange layout items (or other layout groups) either horizontally or vertically. At the same time, layout groups are used as containers that display dashboard item groups. Thus, a dashboard layout is hierarchically arranged from the root layout group to bottommost layout items, which display individual dashboard items. Item Resizing You can resize individual items/groups of items by dragging their edges. For this, follow the steps below. In the area allowing you to resize items, cursor types will be changed to column resize / row resize. Left-click and drag the cursor until you get the expected sizes and release the left mouse button. The dashboard items change their sizes. Maximize and Restore Item You can expand any dashboard item to fit the dashboard to examine data in greater detail. The expanded dashboard item size in this case is the same as the root layout group. Click the Maximize button in the dashboard item caption to maximize a dashboard item. Click Restore to restore the item's size. Item Positioning You can change the position of a dashboard item by using drag-and-drop and the dashboard item's Move button. Depending on the required dashboard item position, a new layout group is created (if required) to maintain the arrangement of items.

Min([Profit]) Mode(Value) Returns the mode of the values. Mode([Profit]) Median(Value) Returns the median of the values. Median([Profit]) Sum(Value) Returns the sum of all values. Sum([Profit]) Var(Value) Returns an estimate of the variance of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. Var([Orders]) Varp(Value) Returns the variance of a population, where the population is the entire data to be summarized. Varp([Orders]) StdDev(Value) Returns an estimate of the standard deviation of a population, where the sample is a subset of the entire population. StdDev([Orders]) StdDevp(Value) Returns the standard deviation of a population, where the population is the entire data to be summarized. StdDevp([Orders]) These functions can be used for all types of numeric fields. After creating such calculated fields, you can use them as measures contained in an OLAP cube. Intermediate Level Aggregations The Web Dashboard can aggregate and summarize data on different levels. The Query Builder allows you to prepare an underlying data source before data analysis. You can group, sort, summarize, and apply other data shaping operations during data selection. Dashboard items aggregate and summarize data at the visualization level using dimensions and measures, respectively. See the following topic to learn more: Bind Dashboard Items to Data. The Aggr function introduces an intermediate detail level that is not related to the visualization level. This allows you to create custom aggregations at different levels and combine these aggregations with existing visualizations."

    "keywords": "Passing Parameter Values In this topic, it describes how to pass the created dashboard parameter to the dashboard. For instance, you can include a dashboard parameter to a WHERE clause of the SQL query or you can filter a dashboard dynamically according to the required parameter value(s). The created dashboard parameter can be used in the following scenarios: SQL Queries Filtering Conditional Formatting Calculated Fields Window Calculations SQL Queries The Web Dashboard provides the capability to bind a dashboard parameter and the existing SQL query/stored procedure parameter. This can be useful when you need to filter the SQL query dynamically by including the parameter value in the WHERE clause. Do the following to bind a dashboard parameter to an SQL query or stored procedure parameter in the Dashboard Data Source Wizard: Select the existing query or stored procedure parameter, or use the Add button to create a new query parameter. Set the Expression as a parameter value and click the ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor for this parameter. In the Expression Editor, add the required dashboard parameter from the Parameters column. Filtering You can filter the specified query of the SQL Data Source, the entire Excel Data Source/Object Data Source or apply filtering to a specific dashboard item according to the current parameter value(s) using the Filter Editor. In the Filter Editor, you can compare a field value with different objects such as static values, values of another field or parameter values. To switch between values, click a down arrow glyph in the operand value placeholder to expand the list of available objects. Select the Parameter object to compare a field value with a parameter value. Then, click the operand value to invoke the list of available parameters and select the existing parameter or create a new one. Conditional Formatting You can apply conditional formatting to a specific dashboard item according to the current parameter value when creating the Expression format condition. Use this capability to format dashboard item elements dynamically, depending on the current parameter value. To switch between values, click the down arrow glyph in the operand value placeholder to expand the list of available objects and select the Parameter object to create a format rule with a parameter. Calculated Fields You can use parameters when constructing expressions for calculated fields. This allows you to evaluate values of the calculated field dynamically depending on the current parameter value. To include a parameter in the expression, double-click the required parameter in the Fields pane. Window Calculations You can use parameters when customizing expressions for window calculations.

    "title": "Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions The DevExpress Dashboard uses criteria language that you can use in various DevExpress products for building expressions. An expression is a string that evaluates some value. The criteria language is based on the the cross-platform library with some additions and subtractions specific for dashboards. This topic details basic and dashboard-specific constants, operators, and functions. The tables below contain constants, operators, and functions you can use in dashboard expressions. Constants Constant Description Example String constants Wrap string constants in apostrophes. If a string contains an apostrophe, double the apostrophe. [Country] == 'France' or [Name] == 'O''Neil' Date-time constants Wrap date-time constants in '#'. [OrderDate] >= #2018-03-22 13:18:51.94944# True Represents the Boolean True value. [InStock] == True False Represents the Boolean False value. [InStock] == False Enumeration Specify an enumeration value using its underlying integer value. Note that you cannot specify an enumeration value using its qualified name. [Status] == 1 Guid Wrap a Guid constant in curly braces. Use Guid constants in a relational operation with equality or inequality operators only. [OrderID] == {513724e5-17b7-4ec6-abc4-0eae12c72c1f} Numeric Specify different numeric constant types in a string form using suffixes: Int32 (int) - 1, Int16 (short) - 1s, Byte (byte) - 1b, Double (double) - 1.0, Single (float) - 1.0f, Decimal (decimal) - 1.0m, [Price] == 25.0m ? Represents a null reference that does not refer to any object. We recommend using the IsNull unary operator (for example, \"[Region] is null\") or the IsNull logical function (for example, \"IsNull([Region])\") instead. [Region] != ? You can build parameterized criteria using any number of positional parameters. To do this, add parameter placeholders (question mark characters) to a criteria expression to identify parameter positions and provide a list of parameter values. When building criteria, parameter placeholders are substituted with parameter values in values in the order they are listed. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Name] == ? and [Age] == ?\", \"John\", 33) The following two examples are identical, but the second one allows you to avoid formatting errors. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#\") CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= ?\", new DateTime(2009, 1, 1)) When parameters are not specified, a parameter placeholder is substituted with null. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Region] != ?\") Operators Operator Description Example + Adds the value of one numeric expression to another or concatenates two strings. [UnitPrice] + 4 or [FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName] - Finds the difference between two numbers. [Price1] - [Price2] * Multiplies the value of two expressions. [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] * (1 - [BonusAmount]) / Divides the first operand by the second. [Quantity] / 2 % Returns the remainder (modulus) obtained by dividing one numeric expression by another. [Quantity] % 3 | Performs a bitwise inclusive OR on two numeric expressions. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag1] [Flag2] & The bitwise AND operator. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Flag] & 10 ^ Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on two numeric expressions. [Flag1] ^ [Flag2] == Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] == 10 = Returns true if both operands have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] = 10 != Returns true if the operands do not have the same value; otherwise, it returns false. [Country] != 'France' < Less than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] < 20 <= Less than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] <= 20 >= Greater than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] >= 30 > Greater than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] > 30 In (,,,) Tests for the existence of a property in an object. [Country] In ('USA', 'UK', 'Italy') Between (,) Specifies a range to test. Returns true if a value is greater than or equal to the first operand and less than or equal to the second operand. [Quantity] Between (10, 20) And Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] And ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) && Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] && ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) Or Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' Or [Country]=='UK' | Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' | [Country]=='UK' ~ Performs a bitwise negation on a numeric expression. ~[Roles] = 251 Not Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. Not [InStock] ! Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. ![InStock] + Returns a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). +[Value] = 10 - Returns the negative of a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). -[Value] = 20 Is Null Returns true if an expression is a null reference, the one that does not refer to any object. [Region] is null Functions Advanced Functions - Intermediate Aggregation Level Function Description Example aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) Uses the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function to aggregate underlying data. aggr(Sum([Sales]), [Category], [Product]) w(WindowExpression, partitionByFunction, orderByFunction) Calculates aggregated values with the specified window function for the window defined by the specified partitioning and ordering. w(RankDense(Sum([ProductSales]), 'desc'), partitionBy([CategoryName]), orderBy()) partitionBy(column1, column2, ...)

For instance, the operators are performed in a default order in the first of the following two code samples. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Amount == 2 + 48 * 2 Amount == (2 + 48) * 2 Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Although field values’ case sensitivity depends on the data source. Note A data source affects certain operators' behavior. For instance, by default, the SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with an escape character (@ sign). In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as the field named \"Or\", not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash () as an escape character for characters in expressions. Examples: \\[ \\\\ \\'"

    "keywords": "Filtering Web Dashboard allows you to filter data in the dashboard items or apply filters to a specific measure. You can use dimensions and hidden dimensions to build filter criteria. Dashboard Item Filter Filters that are applied to a dashboard item affect only this item. Open a dashboard item's Filters menu, go to the Item Filter section and click Edit to add a filter: This invokes the Filter Editor dialog where you can specify filter criteria: Tip Documentation: Filter Editor Measure Filter You can apply filters to individual measures. If you create multiple measures that only differ in applied filters, you can compare values calculated over different date-time periods or against different categories. Open a dashboard item's Binding menu and select a measure to filter. In the invoked data item menu, open the Filter section and click Edit. This invokes the Filter Editor dialog where you can specify filter criteria. Tip Documentation: Filter Editor You can clear the applied filter in the data item menu's Filter section. Note The measure filter is technically an expression that uses the filter(summaryExpression, filterCriteria) function, where summaryExpression is the measure to be filtered and filterCriteria is the filter. See the following topic for more information about functions you can use in dashboard expressions: Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions. The image below shows a Chart with three measures: 2019 - Opened is filtered by year 2019. 2020 - Opened is filtered by year 2020. Opened is the original measure without filters. Visible Data Filter You can specify a Visible Data Filter to limit displayed data. This filter type does not filter underlying data used in calculations or intermediate level aggregations. Open a dashboard item's Filters menu, go to the Visible Data Filter section and click Edit to invoke the Filter Editor, where you can specify a condition: For example, a Grid dashboard item has 35 rows and displays sales percentages. The image below shows the difference between filters (the filter condition is the same): Dashboard Item Filter: sales percentages are recalculated based on the visible data. Visible Data Filter: sales percentages remain the same because this filter type does not affect calculations. OLAP Filtering Specifics You cannot build complex filter criteria to filter data in OLAP mode. Filters for a measure are also not supported. Instead, you can filter dimension attributes and hierarchies: you can select the values you want (or do not want) to include in the dashboard. Dimension Attribute For dimension attributes, the Filter Editor contains a list of all values. The search panel is available for non-hierarchical fields. Dimension Hierarchy The Filter Editor displays hierarchies as a tree and allows you to filter values at any hierarchy level."

To reset filtering, use the Clear Master Filter button (the icon) in the dashboard item's caption. Single - Allows you to select only one element in the Master Filter item. When this mode is enabled, the default selection will be set to a Master Filter element. You can change this selection, but cannot clear it. To disable the Master Filter, select None as a Master Filter mode. Filtering Across Data Sources When different items in a dashboard are bound to different data sources, you can specify that a particular Master Filter should be applied across data sources. This means that it will apply filtering to fields with matching names in all data sources. To filter data across data sources, enable the Cross-Data-Source Filtering in the dashboard item's Interactivity menu. Preventing Items from Being Filtered You can prevent specific dashboard items from being affected by Master Filters. To do this, enable the Ignore Master Filters option in the dashboard item's Interactivity menu."

Starting from this state, users typically begin each filtering operation by deselecting All, before they select individual items. An extra click is required to begin any actual filtering operation, because the standard filter mode shows all items selected. This is not an optimal implementation for performance reasons, because it generates filtering criteria that are evaluated by the data layer and/or the database. To solve these issues, the Neutral Filter Mode is implemented. It is neutral in the sense that it does not apply any criteria to the data source in its default state, resulting in improved performance. All items are shown deselected. This means that an extra click is no longer required in the most common scenarios, and this behavior is familiar to end users from websites world-wide. The Neutral Filter Mode helps in a situation when there is a potential “dead lock”, due to the fact that multiple filter elements influence each other. The Clear Master Filter button resets the filters."

Click this node and select the desired type to change the logical operator. Click the plus button next to the operator to add a new condition or group. To set a new condition, specify the dimension (including hidden dimensions): Then specify a comparison operator: Set an operand value type in the dedicated value box: The following operand types are available: Value - Allows you to compare dimension and static values. Property - Compares different dimension values. Parameter - Allows you to compare dimension and dashboard parameter values. Click the filter condition's Remove button to delete the condition. Advanced Mode Advanced Mode allows you to enter a custom filter string. Consider the following syntax conventions when you create text-based filter conditions: Insert a dimension by enclosing its name in square brackets (for example, [Category]). Denote string values with apostrophes (for example, 'Bikes'). Enclose date-time values with hashtags (for example, #2019-06-01#). Reference dashboard parameters by adding a question mark before their names (for example, [Category] = ?categoryParam) This editor supports intelligent code completion (which suggests functions, parameters, and available data columns as you type). You can add a comment to your expression to explain it and make the expression more readable. Comments can be multi-line, and begin with /* and end with */. The Warning icon appears if a condition contains errors. OLAP Filtering Specifics You cannot build complex filter criteria to filter data in OLAP mode. Filters for a measure are also not supported. Instead, you can filter dimension attributes and hierarchies: you can select the values you want (or do not want) to include in the dashboard. Dimension Attribute For dimension attributes, the Filter Editor contains a list of all values. The search panel is available for non-hierarchical fields. Dimension Hierarchy The Filter Editor displays hierarchies as a tree and allows you to filter values at any hierarchy level."

    "keywords": "Query Builder The Query Builder is a visual query editor. You can use it to add data tables and views to the SQL data sources, and select which columns to include. For federated data sources, you can create a federated query. Query Builder for SQL Data Sources Add Tables Drag a specific table or view to the Query Builder design surface pane to include it in a query: Then select the columns to include in the query: The Query Builder provides a toolbar with the following commands: Icon Description Removes the selected table or view from the query. Reverses the most recent action. Restores the previously undone action. Join Tables The Query Builder allows you to join tables and/or views. Use drag and drop to connect corresponding columns (key fields). A relationship line is drawn between two connected tables / views. Note the connected columns should have identical data types. The Query Builder automatically joins a table or view that has a relationship at database level with any recently added tables. The Query Builder allows you to change the join type (if necessary). Click a relationship line to display the Relation Properties section. Properties in this section define the join type (Inner or Left Outer) and applied logical operator. A left outer join returns all values from an inner join along with all values in the \"left\" table that do not match the \"right\" table. The result also includes rows with NULL (empty) values in the key field. If you select the left outer join, the relationship line displays an arrow which points to the \"right\" table of the join clause. The executed query returns a \"flat\" table that joins different tables within a single query. Select the relationship line and click Delete (the icon) to delete an unnecessary relationship. Edit Column Settings Select a table or view, and click a data column to display the data column options. The Column Properties section contains the following options: Option Description Name Indicates the column name that the Query Builder obtains from the database. Type Indicates the column's data type. The Query Builder provides information about the maximum string length for string columns. Alias Specifies a custom column name (alias). Include a column into a query to enable this option. Aggregated columns should always have an alias. Output Specifies whether to include a column in a query result. Sort Type Specifies whether to maintain the initial sort order for a column, or sort data records in ascending or descending order. Sort Order Defines the sorting priority for multiple columns (the less this number is, the higher the priority). Group By Specifies whether to group a query result by this column. Aggregate Specifies whether to aggregate the column's data records. You can use the following aggregate functions: Count, Max, Min, Avg, Sum, CountDistinct, AvgDistinct, SumDistinct. The Query Builder omits individual data records from the query result and only retains the aggregate function result when you apply any of these functions. Use Query Parameters Use the Parameters section to add, remove and edit query parameters. Each query parameter allows you to configure the following properties: Option Description Name Specifies the query parameter's name. Type Specifies the parameter value's data type. Set this property to Expression to generate parameter values dynamically. Result Type Specifies the data type of the expression's result value. This property is enabled if the query parameter type is Expression. Value Determines the query parameter's actual value. You can specify a static value according to the selected value's data type. Alternatively, construct an expression to generate parameter values dynamically. Click this property's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor and create an expression. This ellipsis button is enabled if you set the query parameter type to Expression. Filter Data The Query Builder can be used to filter a query. To do this, deselect tables and click the ellipsis button in the invoked Filter field in the Properties pane. This invokes the Filter Editor dialog, which provides a visual interface for constructing a filter string. See the following topic for details: Filter Queries. Preview Data Click the Preview Results button to test a query on the actual data's limited subset. The invoked Data Preview dialog displays the first 100 data records of the query: Query Builder for Federated Data Sources The Query Builder supports the following query types for the federated data source: Join - Combines rows from two or more sources based on a clause. Union and Union All - The Union query combines rows from two or more sources into one data set and removes duplicate rows in the merged source. The Union All query does the same, except it doesn't remove duplicated rows. You can create a union query for data sources if data types of their columns are implicitly converted. Transformation - If a data source contains a complex column (an object), you can transform its properties to display them as separate columns in a flattened view. If one of the data columns is an array, you can unfold its values and display a new data row for every element of the array. When you unfold the column, you can flatten it and create a flattened view. Create a Join-Based Federated Data Source In the invoked Query Builder, add the tables from the data sources (drag or double-click them). Use drag-and-drop to create a relationship based on the key field. Enable checkboxes for the data fields you want to include in the query result set. You can also specify a different name for a field: set the alias in the Alias column for the corresponding field (for example, City for the ShipCity field on the image below). In the image below columns from the two data sources are added to the query: You can specify the expression for the field. For this, enable the f button and then click ellipsis button: This invokes the Expression Editor and you can specify a calculated field. Click OK to close the Query Builder. Rename the created query if necessary. Click Finish to create the federated data source with the Join query and close the Data Source Wizard. Add the newly created data source to the dashboard to see the result: Create a Union-Based Federated Data Source Double-click the Customers table and the Excel data source. The query includes only fields that have identical names and types in the origin sources. Enable the Union All check box to create the Union All query and do not remove duplicated rows. You can also specify a different name for a field: set the alias in the Alias column for the corresponding field. In the image below, two sources are added to the query: Click OK to close the Query Builder. Rename the created query if necessary. Click Finish to create the federated data source with the Union/UnionAll query and close the Data Source Wizard. Add the newly created data source to the dashboard to see the result: Create a Transformation-Based Data Source In the invoked Query Builder, select the data source or query that contains columns you want to transform. Select the Transform check box next to the column you need to unfold and flatten. You can specify the aliases for the generated columns. In the image below the Query Builder transforms the Products column from the JSON data source: Click OK to close the Query Builder. Rename the created query if necessary. Click Finish to create the federated data source with the Transformation query and close the Data Source Wizard. Add the newly created data source to the dashboard to see the result:"

    "title": "Dock Panels | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Dock Panels This topic describes the most common runtime operations for dock panels. Docking Hints Dock panels can be docked, floating or auto-hidden. To dock or undock a panel, simply click its header and drag the panel. As you drag the panel over an application form, docking hints appear (see the figure below). Use these hints to dock the panel to the desired position. Docking hints are semi-transparent square elements that allow you to dock a panel to a form's edges, or to an existing container as a tab, or between other docking elements. These hints are displayed separately or grouped in a docking guide (e.g., in the form's central area). Finally, a docking zone is a semi-transparent preview of exactly where your panel will be docked. This zone is displayed when you drag a panel into a docking hint, but before you drop it. Buttons Dock panels have multiple state change buttons in their top right corner. Close - closes the current panel. Maximize/Restore - maximizes the panel to full-screen size, or restores it back to its original size. Available only for floating panels. Auto-hide/Dock - hides the panel, leaving only its header visible, or restores an auto-hidden panel back to the docked state. Depending on the application settings, hidden panels are displayed either on mouse hover or on click only. Available only for docked panels. Pin - places the panel in the first tab position. Available only for panels docked as tabbed documents. Context Menu Most docking operations are available from the panel's context menu, displayed on right-click. The figure below illustrates the context menu for a docked panel. For dock panels docked as tabbed documents, the context menu displays multiple additional items, which allow you to pin the panel or start a new horizontal or vertical group within the docked area (see the image below). Interoperability with Documents and Other Dock Panels When dragging a dock panel, you can dock it to other dock panels. This will create a dock panel container that presents both panels as tabs. Note that in addition to docking panels via docking hints, you can also drag them to the tab header area. This allows you to instantly rearrange panels within the container (see the animation below). Dock panels can be docked to both the dock panel docking areas (the form's edges) as well as to the tabbed View. Documents, however, can only be docked within the tabbed View, and not to the docking areas. Mouse Operations and Hotkeys Double-click a docked panel's caption - undocks the panel and makes it floating. This does not work with auto-hide panels. Ctrl+Double-click a floating panel's caption - docks the floating panel to its previous docking position. Esc while dragging a panel - cancels the dock operation and drops the panel at the current position. Ctrl+Tab or Crtl+Shift+Tab - shows the Document Selector. See the Dock Panels topic to learn more about the Document Selector."

    "title": "Documents | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Documents Document objects resemble dock panels and serve the very same goal - to host content within floating or tabbed MDI windows. You can click a document’s caption, and drag this document to dock or undock it in the same manner as dock panels. However, there are certain differences between documents and dock panels. View While dock panels can be docked to any form’s edge, documents can only be docked in a special area called a tabbed View. When you drag a document, docking hints will tell you where this area is. The image below illustrates a tabbed View within a tabbed MDI application. Dock panels can also be docked into this area, but documents cannot be docked to auto-hide containers and form edges. Floating Document Container As you can see from the image above, documents can be nested into a floating document container. If this feature is enabled, it allows you to organize all of your floating documents in a single floating container (and avoid a cluttered UI with multiple floating windows). If you want to dock your floating documents once again, simply drag this container in the same manner in which you drag documents. Docking a floating container into a tabbed View will dock all of the container's documents into this View. You can also rearrange within or drag individual documents out of this container. Tabbed Groups Documents within a tabbed View can be docked to vertical or horizontal document groups. To do so, use the side docking hint when dragging a document, or right-click the document header and select the New Tab Group item in the invoked context menu (see the figure below). Document groups are divided by splitters. You can drag the splitter to resize the groups, as shown in the figure below. Document groups can display Next and Previous buttons, which allow you to scroll through tab headers when there is not enough free space within the group to display all of the headers. Document groups within a View can either be arranged horizontally (side-by-side), or vertically (one above another), but not in both directions simultaneously. If only one tabbed group exists, the View does not yet have an orientation setting. After you start a new horizontal tab group, for example, the View becomes vertically oriented, which means that all subsequent tab groups can only be arranged vertically. You can reverse the current View orientation by right-clicking any tab group header and selecting the Arrange Tab Groups Vertically (Horizontally) context menu item. Navigation To navigate through documents (and dock panels, if any exist), you can use the Document Selector, invoked via the CTRL+Tab keyboard hotkey. This tool displays a small preview of each focused document (dock panel) and its short description. You can see the Document Selector in the next image. To quickly navigate through documents, you can also use the button in the group's top right corner. Finally, you can right-click a document group's header and select the Windows... item to display the Windows dialog, which lists all currently opened documents and their paths (see the image below). Mouse Operations and Keyboard Shortcuts Double-click a docked document's caption - undock the document and make it floating. Ctrl+Double-click a floating document's caption - docks the floating document to its previous docking position. Ctrl+Tab or Ctrl+Shift+Tab - shows the Document Selector."

To do this, add parameter placeholders (question mark characters) to a criteria expression to identify parameter positions and provide a list of parameter values. When building criteria, parameter placeholders are substituted with parameter values in values in the order they are listed. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Name] == ? and [Age] == ?\", \"John\", 33) The following two examples are identical, but the second one allows you to avoid formatting errors. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#\") CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[OrderDate] >= ?\", new DateTime(2009, 1, 1)) When parameters are not specified, a parameter placeholder is substituted with null. CriteriaOperator.Parse(\"[Region] != ?\") Collection Elements Verification Use brackets \"[]\" to check if a collection contains an element that satisfies a condition. The following expression returns true if the Accounts collection contains at least one element that satisfies the [Amount] == 100 condition: [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] The following expression returns false if the Accounts collection is empty: [Accounts][] Parent Relating Operator Use the parent relating operator ('^' character) to refer to a parent in expressions written in the context of a child. You can apply this operator successively to navigate multiple parent relationships. In the expression below, the \"RegistrationDate\" field refers to a Customer (Orders' parent) and the \"Date\" field refers to Orders. This expression returns true if there is at least one Order that is made on the day the parent Customer is registered: \"[Orders][[^.RegistrationDate] == Date]\" Grouping Clauses with Brackets It is important to use brackets to ensure that your expression returns the intended results. For instance, the following expression for objects of the Customer type returns all of the Customers where an Account exists with a Date of 8/25/2006 and where an account exists with an Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006#] && [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] Construct the expression as in the following example to search for all Customers that have an Account with both a Date of 8/25/2006 and an Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006# && [Amount] == 100] Operator Precedence When an expression contains multiple operators, their precedence controls the order in which expression elements are evaluated. Literal values Parameters Identifiers OR (left-associative) AND (left-associative) '.' relationship qualifier (left-associative) ==, != <, >, <=, >= -, + (left-associative) *, /, % (left-associative) NOT unary - In Iif Trim(), Len(), Substring(), IsNull() '[]' (for set-restriction) '()' The default precedence can be changed by grouping elements with parentheses. For instance, the operators are performed in a default order in the first of the following two code samples. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Accounts[Amount == 2 + 48 * 2] Accounts[Amount == (2 + 48) * 2] Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Although field values’ case sensitivity depends on the data source. Note A data source affects certain operators' behavior. For instance, a data source can be configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escaping Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with an escape character (@ sign). In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as the field named \"Or\", not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash (\\) as an escape character for characters in expressions. Examples: \\[ \\\\ \\' Retrieving Reference Properties Note that while a criteria expression can return an object reference, this is not supported in all scenarios. Returning an object reference by directly referencing a property, as in the following code snippet, is fully supported. \"Iif(Part is null, MyCustOrderLine.Part, Part)\" In this code snippet, the Part object, which the Part or MyCustOrderLine.Part property references, is returned correctly. However, retrieving reference properties from functions is not supported. So, the following expression does not work. \"Iif(Part is null, MyCustOrderLine, MyCustOrderLine2).Part\" Note - Restrictions Note the following restriction when exporting DevExpress Data Grid and Tree List controls (WinForms and WPF) to the XLS(X) format in Data-Aware Export Mode: Only expressions that contain export-friendly functions are exported to XLS(X) format. Refer to the XLS(x) Format Export-Friendly column in the tables above to find out if a function can be exported to XLS(x) format."

    "keywords": "Examples of Using the Filter Editor The Filter Editor allows you to filter data (display those records that meet specific requirements), by visually constructing filter criteria in a straightforward graphical form. The following sections demonstrate how to construct filter criteria using the Filter Editor. How to Construct a Simple Filter Condition Basically, filter conditions specify what data to select from a data source and display in a data-bound control. A typical simple filter condition consists of three parts: the column/field name, operator and a value(s). For instance, '[Discount] >= 0.05' is a simple filter condition, where '[Discount]' is a field name, '>=' is an operator and '0.05' is a value. This condition when applied to a data-aware control will display records that have values in the Discount column greater than or equal to 0.05. Here is how to create this condition via the Filter Editor (it's assumed that the underlying data source contains the Discount column, otherwise, this column will not be accessible in the Filter Editor's column list): Invoke the Filter Editor. To invoke the Filter Editor in a grid control, right-click any grid column's header and select the Filter Editor option. To learn how to invoke the Filter Editor for other controls, see corresponding sections in this documentation. Select a column. To filter against the Discount column, click the column name field. This will display the list of available columns. Select the Discount column in this list: Select a comparison operator. Click the operator field to choose the required operator. The comparison operator list displays only those operators that are supported by the current column's data type. For instance, the Discount column is of the numeric type, and the operator list doesn't display the 'Begins with' operator and other operators that are related to strings. Enter a value. Now, click the value box and enter a comparison value ('0.05'): Save changes. Click OK or Apply, to filter data using the created filter condition. The grid will show the filter panel displaying the current filter criteria: The filter panel will contain the 'Edit Filter' button, which also allows you to invoke the Filter Editor. How to Construct Filter Criteria with Multiple Conditions Joined by One Logical Operator Filter criteria typically consist of two or more simple filter conditions combined by logical operators (AND, OR, NOT AND, NOT OR). The following example shows how to construct filter criteria in the Filter Editor that consist of multiple conditions combined by one logical operator. The \"[ProductName] = 'Tofu' AND [Discount] >= 0.1 AND [Quantity] > 99\" filter expression contains three simple filter conditions combined by the AND operator. To construct it, do the following: Invoke the Filter Editor. When the Filter Editor is invoked for a grid control, the Filter Editor may display an unfinished new filter condition: Set the condition's operator to Equals and operand value to 'Tofu' (as described in the previous section): To add one more condition, press the button next to the group's AND operator. This will create a new condition under the current one: For the second condition, set the column to 'Unit Price', operator to '>=' and operand value to '100': To add a third condition to the same group, click the button again. Set the condition's column to 'Units in Stock', operator to '>' and operand value to '50'. Below is the result: Click OK or Apply, to apply the created filter criteria. How to Construct Filter Criteria Involving Different Logical Operators Some filter criteria contain multiple logical (Boolean) operators combining simple filter conditions. For instance, you want to see items whose price is under 10, and at the same time, the available quantity is also less than 10. At the same time, you may also want to see those items whose price is over 10, while the available quantity is also greater than 10. The resulting condition will look like this: (Price is less than 10 AND Quantity is less than 10) OR (Price is greater than 10 AND Quantity is greater than 10) This is how you can do this: Invoke the Filter Editor. Clear existing filter conditions (if any) by clicking the button: Change the root logical operator to OR. To do this, click the current AND operator and select OR: Add a new filter condition group by clicking the OR operator and selecting Add Group. For the created condition, set the column to 'UnitPrice', operator to '<' and operand value to '10': Click the button to add a new condition to the current group: For the new condition, set the column to 'Quantity', operator to '<' and operand value to '10': Add a new filter condition group. To do this, click the root OR operator and select Add Group. For the condition within the created group, set the column to 'UnitPrice', operator to '>' and operand value to '10': Click the button to add a new condition to the new group. For the new condition, set the column to 'Quantity', operator to '>' and operand value to '10': Click OK or Apply, to apply the created filter criteria."

To create and customize filter criteria, use the and buttons embedded into the control and context menus supported by the editor's elements: Remarks A filter condition group is a set of conditions combined by the same logical operator. The following filter expression contains two groups combined by the logical OR operator: \"([Product] = 'Chang' And [Quantity] > 20) Or ([Product] In ('Tofu', 'Konbu') And [Quantity] < 100)\". In the Filter Editor it's represented as follows: For step-by-step examples of creating filter criteria, see Examples of Using the Filter Editor.

    "keywords": "Apply Cell Conditional Formatting You can highlight certain column cells that meet a specific condition using the Conditional Formatting menu. To invoke this menu, right-click the column to which a formatting rule should be applied and select Conditional Formatting. Available format rules are displayed when expanding the Conditional Formatting menu. Different options are supported for different columns (depending on the type of data a clicked column displays). Highlighting Cells that Meet a Specific Condition Choose the Highlight Cell Rules menu item. Select the condition type. You can use one of the predefined conditions (the Greater Than..., Less Than.., Between... and Equal To... menu items), provide a custom condition (the Custom Condition.. item) or format cells that contain the specified text (Text that Contains...) or refer to a certain date interval(s) (A Date Occurring...). Based on the selected condition type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. You need to either enter a constant to be compared with the column's values, or select desired check boxes related to dates, or construct a custom condition in the dedicated editor. After that, choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Top or Bottom Cell Values Choose the Top/Bottom Rules menu item. Select the rule type. You can highlight cells that contain the highest or lowest values (the Top 10%..., Bottom 10%..., Top 10 Items... and Bottom 10 Items... menu items), and values that are above or below the column's average (Above Average and Below Average). According to the selected rule type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. Enter a cutoff value (where required), choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Unique or Duplicate Cell Values Choose the Unique/Duplicate Rules menu item. Select the rule type. In the invoked dialog window, choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Cells Using Data Bars A data bar fills a cell according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest column values. A longer bar corresponds to a higher value, and a shorter bar corresponds to a lower value. To apply a data bar format, do the following: Choose the Data Bars menu item. Select the bar style format. Solid bars and bars with gradient fills are available in various colors. Applying Color Scales This format shows data distribution and variation using color scales. A cell is filled with the background color that is calculated according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest column values. A two-color scale specifies two colors, which represent the minimum and maximum column values. Cell values residing between the minimum and maximum values are painted using a shade of these colors. A three-color scale additionally defines a color for the middle value and so, uses a gradation of three colors. Choose the Color Scales menu item. Select one of the predefined two or three-color scales. Highlighting Cells Using Predefined Icons Icon sets allow you to classify column values into several ranges separated by threshold values, and display a specific icon in a column cell according to the range to which this cell value belongs. In the Positive/Negative group, the available icon sets divide column values into three ranges: positive values, negative values and values equal to zero. Other icon sets divide column values into three, four or five ranges, displaying a specific icon for each range. If an icon set contains three icons, the ranges are as follows: [0%-33%), [33%-67%) and [67%-100%], where 0% corresponds to the smallest column value and 100% corresponds to the largest column value. The icon sets with four icons classify column values into four ranges: [0%-25%), [25%-50%), [50%-75%) and [75%-100%]. For the icon sets that contain five icons, the target ranges are: [0%-20%), [20%-40%), [40%-60%), [60%-80%) and [80%-100%]. Choose the Icon Sets menu item. Select one of the predefined icon sets. Deleting Rules If you have already applied one or more rules to columns, the additional Clear Rules item is displayed at the second level of the Conditional Formatting menu. You can do one of the following. To delete conditional formatting rules from the target column, click the Clear Rules from This Column menu item. If the column has no rules applied to it, this item is not shown. or To delete formatting rules from all columns, click the Clear Rules from All Columns menu item ."

    "keywords": "Filter Grid Data via Find Panel The Find Panel provides an easy way of searching against visible columns/card fields. Displayed above the grid, the panel contains a search box where you can type a search string. Invoke the Find Panel Ensure that no cell editor is active and press Ctrl+F. or In Grid Views, choose the Show Find Panel command from a column menu. Search Enter a search string in the search box. In most cases, rows are filtered automatically after a short while. In some cases (mostly when the grid is bound to a large amount of data), you need to press the Find button to manually start the search. The search syntax is described below. Clear the Search Box Press ESC or click the Clear button. Close the Find Panel Click the 'x' button to the left of the search box or: If the search box is empty, press ESC (the shortcut is in effect if the search box has focus); If the search box is not empty, press ESC twice (the shortcut is in effect if the search box has focus). Search Syntax In its simplest form, a search criterion consists of a single word. If you want to search for a string containing a space character, specify this string in quotation marks. Without quotation marks, words separated by the space character are treated as individual conditions. You can search against a specific column by preceding a search string with the column's display name plus a colon character. ColumnDisplayName:SearchString Instead of the complete name, it is possible to partially specify the display name, using the initial characters of a column's display name. A search will be performed against the first column whose display name starts with the specified substring. If you want to search against a column whose display caption contains space characters, specify the column's display caption in quotation marks. If the search string contains multiple conditions separated by space characters, and at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, only records that match all of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). If there is no column specification, records that match at least one of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the OR logical operator). Precede a condition with \"+\" to display only records that match this condition. The \"+\" specifier allows you to implement the logical AND operator. There should be no space character between the \"+\" sign and the condition. Precede a condition with \"-\" to exclude records that match this condition from the result set. There should be no space between the \"-\" sign and the condition.

Expressions allow you to calculate values based on values of other fields. An expression is a string that, when parsed and processed, evaluates a value. Expressions consist of field names, constants, operators, and functions. Field names must be wrapped in brackets. Here are examples of expressions: \"[Quantity] * [UnitPrice] * (1 - [BonusAmount])\" \"[FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName]\" \"[Country] == 'USA'\" \"[OrderDate] > #8/16/1994# AND [Quantity] > 20\" For more information about syntax you can use in expressions, see Pivot Grid Expression Syntax."

    "title": "Pivot Grid Expression Syntax | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Pivot Grid Expression Syntax The following topic contains constants, operators, and functions you can use in Pivot Grid expressions. Note Refer to Criteria Language Syntax for a list of basic constants, operators, and functions DevExpress products support. Constants Constant Description Example String Wrap string constants in apostrophes. [Country] = 'France' constants If a string contains an apostrophe, use double apostrophes. [Name] = 'O''Neil' Date-time constants Wrap date-time constants in hash symbol '#'. [OrderDate] >= #2018-03-22 13:18:51.94944# Represents the 'True' Boolean value. [InStock] = True [InStock] = True False Represents the 'False' Boolean value. [InStock] = False Enumeration To specify an enumeration value, use its underlying integer value. Do not use an enumeration's qualified name in an expression. Correct: [Status] = 1 Incorrect: [Status] = Status.InProgress GUID Wrap a GUID constant in curly braces. Use GUID constants only with equality and inequality operators. [OrderID] = {513724e5-17b7-4ec6-abc4-0eae12c72c1f} Numeric Add suffixes to literals to specify a numeric type: * Int32 (int) * Int16 (short) * Byte (byte) * Double (double) * Single (float) * Decimal (decimal) * [ID] = 25 * [Qty] = 25s * [ByteField] = 201b * [Price] = 25.0 * [Price] = 25.0f * [Price] = 25.0m ? A missing, invalid or unknown value. We recommend using the IsNull unary operator (\"[Region] Is Null\") or the IsNull logical function (\"IsNull([Region])\") instead. [Region] != ? Operators Operator Description Example + Calculates the sum of two numeric operands. Concatenates the string representations of operands, if one of them is a string. [UnitPrice] + 4 [FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName] - Subtracts the second operand from the first operand. [Price1] - [Price2] * Multiplies operands. [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] / Divides the first operand by the second operand. [Quantity] / 2 % Returns the remainder after division of the first operand by the second operand. [Quantity] % 3 | Performs a bitwise inclusive OR on two numeric expressions. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Number] | [Number] & The bitwise AND operator. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If both bits are 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Number] & 10 ^ Performs a bitwise exclusive OR on two numeric expressions. [Number] ^ [Number] = == Returns true if operands are equal; otherwise, it returns false. [Quantity] = 10 != Returns true if operands are not equal; otherwise, it returns false. [Country] != 'France' < Relational 'less than' operator. [UnitPrice] < 20 <= Relational 'less than or equal' operator. [UnitPrice] <= 20 >= Relational 'greater than or equal' operator. [UnitPrice] >= 30 > Relational 'greater than' operator. [UnitPrice] > 30 And && Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] And ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) [InStock] && ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) Or || Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' Or [Country]=='UK' [Country]=='USA' || [Country]=='UK' ~ Performs a bitwise negation on a numeric expression. ~[Roles] = 251 Not ! Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. Not [InStock] ![InStock] + Returns a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). +[Value] = 10 - Returns the negative of a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). -[Value] = 20 Is Null Returns true if an expression is a null reference, the one that does not refer to any object. [Region] is null In (value1,value2,...) Specifies a list of values to test. Returns true if an operand is equal to a value contained in a list. [Country] In ('USA', 'UK', 'Italy') Between (value1,value2) Specifies a range to test. Returns true if an operand is greater than or equal to the value1 and less than or equal to the value2. [Quantity] Between(10, 20) [Product Name] Between('Ikura','Pavlova') Aggregate Functions Function Description Example Avg(Value) Returns the average of the values.

For instance, the operators are performed in the default order in the first code sample below. In the second code sample, the addition operation is performed first because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is performed last. Accounts[Amount == 2 + 48 * 2] Accounts[Amount == (2 + 48) * 2] Case Sensitivity Operators are case insensitive. Note A data source affects certain operators' behavior. For instance, SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case insensitive. In this case, the following expression always evaluates to true: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Characters Use a backslash () as an escape character for characters in expressions, for example: \\[ \\\\ \\' Export to XLS and XLSX The Pivot Grid does not export expressions to XLS and XLSX format."

This feature helps to highlight important information, identify trends and exceptions, and compare data. To invoke the menu, do the following. Right-click the data cell corresponding to the intersection of the required data, row and column field. Select the required rule from the list. Available format rules are displayed when expanding the Format Rules menu. Highlighting Cells that Meet a Specific Condition This rule formats cells if values matches one of the predefined conditions, custom condition or contain the specified text. To apply this format, do the following: Choose the Highlight Cell Rules menu item and select the rule type. According to the selected rule type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. Specify the rule value(s), choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to all data cells instead of an intersection, clear the Apply only to specific level check box. Highlighting Top or Bottom Cell Values This rule formats cells that contain the highest or lowest values, and values that are above or below the average of the field intersection data cells value. To apply this format, do the following: Choose the Top/Bottom Rules menu item and select the rule type. According to the selected rule type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. Specify the rule value if it is necessary, choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. Highlighting Cells Using Data Bars A data bar fills a cell according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest field intersection data cells values. A longer bar corresponds to a higher value, and a shorter bar, to a lower value. To apply this format, choose the Data Bars menu item and select the bar style format. Solid bars and bars with gradient fills are available in various colors. Applying Color Scales This format shows data distribution and variation using color scales. A cell is filled with a background color that is calculated according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest field intersection data cells values. To apply this format, choose the Color Scales menu item and select one of the predefined two or three-color scales. Highlighting Cells Using Predefined Icons Icon sets allow you to classify data cells values into three, four or five ranges separated by threshold values, and display a specific icon in a cell according to the range to which this cell value belongs. In the Positive/Negative group, the available icon sets divide column values into three ranges: positive values, negative values and values equal to zero. To apply this format, choose the Icon Sets menu item and select one of the predefined icon sets. Conditional Formatting Rules Manager You can create, sort and modify the created rules using the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager. To invoke this manager, select the Manage Rules... item from the Format Rules context menu. To create a new rule, click the New Rule... button, select a rule type and specify its parameters. Depending on rule type, you can set maximum and minimum values, specify format, colors or icon style, etc. To edit the existing rule, click the Edit Rule... button and change the rule parameters.

    "keywords": "Using Filter Windows Depending on the settings made by your application vendor, the Pivot Table can display an individual Filter Window for each field, or an integrated Filter Window for a group of fields. This topic describes how to filter data using both types of Filter Windows. Excel-style Filter Window The Excel-style filter popup's content depends on the type of data the related field displays. In the \"Values\" tab, end-users can select specific field values from the Pivot Grid. The \"Filters\" tab supplies users with additional options related to the field type. For example, when filtering a string field, you can show only those records that begin with 'C': Filters applied using the Excel-style filter popup are displayed in the Filter Panel and can be changed in the Filter Editor dialog, which allows end-users to apply complex filter conditions. The Excel-style filter cannot be used to apply filtering in OLAP mode. Simple Filter Window A simple Filter Window allows you to hide visible and show previously hidden values of a particular field. In the Filter Window, uncheck field values that should be hidden and check values that should be visible. Then, click OK to close the window and apply the filtering. Note that you can customize Filter Window settings using the toolbar displayed at the top of the window. To learn how to do this, see Filtering Options. Hierarchical Filter Window A hierarchical Filter Window displays values of several fields, arranged in a tree-like manner. In the Filter Window, uncheck field values that should be hidden and check values that should be visible. Use the buttons to expand field values and access their child values. To collapse an expanded field value and hide its child values, use the button. You can also expand and collapse all values on a particular level. To do this, right-click any field value and select Collapse All or Expand All from the context menu. For instance, to expand all quarters and display months, right-click any quarter value and select Expand All from the context menu as shown on the image below. Click OK to close the window and apply the filtering. Note that you can customize Filter Window settings using the toolbar displayed at the top of the window. To learn how to do this, see Filtering Options. Filtering Indication You can determine whether a field is filtered by looking at its header. Filter buttons for these fields are visible even when you are not hovering over their headers. Removing Filtering To remove filtering against a specific field, invoke its Filter Window and select (Show All)."

    "keywords": "Create a Table of Contents Create a TOC Using Built-In Heading Styles The easiest way to create a TOC is to use built-in heading styles. Mark TOC Entries Select the text (heading) that you want to appear in a TOC. Click the Add Text button on the References tab and then select the required level (for example, if you want the selected text to be displayed as the main heading in the TOC, click Level 1, etc.). If you change your mind and decide not to include the selected text in the TOC, click Do Not Show in Table of Contents. [ After you have applied levels in a newly created document once or if you have opened a document with specified TOC entires by using heading styles, the corresponding heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) are automatically added to the list of available styles accessed via the Styles page group. In this case you can mark TOC entries by choosing these heading styles. Build a TOC After you have specified all required TOC entries, everything is ready to generate a TOC. Click within the document where you want to insert a TOC. In the Table of Contents group, click Table of Contents. This will automatically generate a TOC that consists of entries marked by using heading styles. If you click the Show All Field Codes button on the Mail Merge toolbar, you will see the TOC field code. By default, it is { TOC \\h }. The \\h switch inserts all TOC entires as hyperlinks. Create a TOC Using Paragraph Outline Levels If you wish to include some text in a TOC without changing the text appearance, you can use outline levels. Unlike heading styles, outline levels applied to text do not affect text formatting characteristics. Mark TOC Entries Select the text that you wish to appear in the TOC. Right-click the selected text and choose Paragraph from the context menu. The Paragraph dialog will invoked. In this dialog, use the Outline level combo box to specify the outline level for the selected text. If you change your mind and decide not to include the selected text to the TOC, click Body Text. Build a TOC After you have specified all required TOC entries, everything is ready to generate a TOC. Click within the document where you want to insert a TOC. Press CTRL+F9 to create an empty field wherein you can manually enter a field code to insert a TOC. In this field, write the { TOC \\u } field code. Use the \\u switch to include text marked with outline levels in the TOC. To show the result TOC, place the cursor in the TOC field, right-click it and select the Update Field item from the context menu, or click the Update Table button on the References tab. Create a TOC Using Fields Along with built-in heading styles and outline levels, there is another way to label text to include it in a TOC - via TC fields. Sometimes it can be quicker and easier to add TC fields to mark TOC entries, rather than format the document using heading styles or outline levels. TC fields can be also helpful if you want to capture a portion of a long heading that should not be entirely included in the TOC and include only that portion in the TOC. In addition, if your document needs two or more TOCs showing different entries, you can mark entries for a particular TOC using TC fields with an identifier, which is specific for each TOC. Mark TOC Entries Click within a document where you want to add a TC field (for example, right below an abstract heading). Press CTRL+F9 to create an empty field wherein you can manually enter a field code (TC in this case) and set required switches. Write the following. {TC \"Entry Text\" \\f A \\l 1 } This will add the \"Entry Text\" first-level item (the \\l switch sets the level of the TC entry) to the TOC with an \\f switch and the A identifier. The \\f switch of the TC field is used to include the TC field in the corresponding TOC. A TC field identifier (A in this case) must exactly match the text in the argument of the TOC field's \\f switch. For example, the {TOC \\f A} table of contents will be created from TC fields like {TC \"Entry Text\" \\f A}. Note TC fields display no result in the document. To view field codes, click Show All Field Codes on the Mail Merge tab. Build a TOC Click within the document where you want to insert a TOC. Press CTRL+F9 to create an empty field wherein you can manually enter a field code to insert a TOC. Write the following: {TOC \\f A} The \\f switch collects the TC field entries in the TOC. This switch's field-argument (A in this case) specifies which TC fields should be included in the TOC (TC fields with the same identifier - A). To show the resulting TOC, place the cursor in the TOC field, right-click it and select the Update Field item from the context menu, or click the Update Table button on the References ribbon tab."

New Appointment Invokes the Edit Appointment dialog. The Start time and End time values are initially set to the lower and upper boundaries of the current date and time selection. Fill in other fields, if necessary. For example, use the large text box at the bottom of the dialog to enter text, which will be shown as an appointment's description in a Day or a Work Week views. You can also select the Reminder check box to enable appointment notifications (see Manage Reminders). New All Day Event Invokes the Edit Event dialog, which is used to create a new all-day appointment (also called 'all-day event'). The dialog is identical to Edit Appointment (shown above), except that in this case, the All day event option is checked, its time range is measured in days (not hours) and marked as Free. The appointment can be transformed into an all-day event and vice-versa by checking this box. New Recurring Appointment All appointments maintained by the scheduler can either be simple (non-recurring - i.e., they happen only once), or recurring - occurring multiple times within a specified time interval. Selecting this menu item invokes the Edit Appointment dialog, used to create a new appointment, and also invokes the Appointment Recurrence dialog, which allows the recurrence pattern to be specified for the new appointment. New Recurring Event Selecting this menu item invokes the Event editor dialog used to create a new all-day appointment, and also invokes the Appointment Recurrence dialog, which allows the recurrence pattern to be specified for the new event. Bar or Ribbon Interface If a scheduler is provided with the Bar or Ribbon interface, you can create new appointments (simple and recurring) using the New Appointment and New Recurring Appointment buttons on the Appointment toolbar or Ribbon page group. These buttons invoke the Edit Appointment and Appointment Recurrence dialogs respectively. Create a new appointment via Bar interface Create a new appointment via Ribbon interface Keyboard Shortcuts and Mouse Operations Action Description An alphanumeric key or ENTER Pressing an alphanumeric key or ENTER invokes an in-place editor where you can type the subject of a new appointment occupying the currently selected area. Once you have typed your appointment's subject, you can either create and save the appointment by pressing ENTER or changing the focus, or cancel the operation by pressing ESC. The type of the created appointment depends on the selected time cell(s). When typing is done in Day or Work-Week view, the appointment is created with the time interval starting with the earliest time of the selected cells and ending with the latest, and the time is marked as Busy. If an all-day area is selected, then an all-day appointment is created with the time marked as Free. When the scheduler display mode is Week or Month view, the appointment is created with the start time set to 12 AM of the first selected day, and the end time is set to 12 AM of the day following the last selected day. Double-click Double-clicking within a scheduler view's time cell that does not contain any appointments invokes the Edit Appointment dialog described above. CTRL+N Pressing CTRL+N invokes the Edit Appointment dialog. Then this dialog can be used to create a new appointment.

Format Cells using Data Bars The data bar conditional formatting rule draws a shaded bar in the background of each cell in the range to which the rule is applied. The length of the data bar represents the cell value. A longer bar represents a higher value, and a shorter bar represents a lower value. For example, the image below shows the markup magnitude using solid light-green data bars. To apply a data bar conditional formatting rule, do the following: On the Home tab, in the Styles group, choose Conditional Formatting | Data Bars, and then select the desired color for a gradient or solid data bar. If none of the built-in formatting options meet your requirements, you can create a custom formatting rule. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Conditional Formatting | New Rule... ...or select Conditional Formatting | Manage Rules... and click the New Rule... button in the invoked Conditional Formatting Rules Manager. In the invoked New Formatting Rule dialog, select the Format cells based on their values type from the Select a Rule Type list. In the Edit Rule Description section, select Data Bar from the Format style: list. Specify the minimum and maximum thresholds type and value (if necessary). To disable showing values in the cells to which the formatting rule is applied, check the Show bar only box. Customize the bar appearance by setting the fill type, fill color, border type and color in the Bar Appearance: section. The resulting data bar appearance is displayed in the Preview box. To specify the negative bar and axis appearance settings, click the Negative Value and Axis... button. The invoked Negative Value and Axis Settings dialog allows you to set the negative bar fill and border color, specify axis color and position within the cell. Format Cells using Color Scales Color scales compare values using a gradation of two or three colors. The shade of the color represents higher, middle and lower values in the cell range to which the rule is applied. For example, the image below shows a price distribution using a gradation of three colors. Red represents the lower values, yellow represents the medium values and sky blue represents the higher values. To create a color scale, do the following: On the Home tab, in the Styles group, choose Conditional Formatting | Color Scales, and then select one of the predefined color combinations. If none of the built-in formatting options meet your requirements, you can create a custom formatting rule. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Conditional Formatting | New Rule... ...or select Conditional Formatting | Manage Rules... and click the New Rule... button in the invoked Conditional Formatting Rules Manager. In the invoked New Formatting Rule dialog, select the Format cells based on their values type from the Select a Rule Type list. In the Edit Rule Description section, select 2- or 3-Color Scale from the Format style: list. Specify the type of the minimum, midpoint (if the 3-color scale style is selected) and the maximum threshold, enter their values (if necessary) and select the corresponding colors. The resulting cell appearance is displayed in the Preview box. Format Cells using Icon Sets An icon set conditional format classifies data in a range into three to five categories. The Spreadsheet divides the range into equal parts based on the number of icons in the selected set and applies an icon to each cell depending on its value. For example, the image below shows the value ranking. A filled star represents values that are greater than or equal to 67 percent, a half-filled star represents values that are less than 67 percent and greater than or equal to 33 percent, and an empty star shows values that are less than 33 percent. To apply an icon set conditional formatting rule, do the following: On the Home tab, in the Styles group, choose Conditional Formatting | Icon Sets, and then select the desired icon set from the gallery. If none of the built-in formatting options meet your requirements, you can create a custom formatting rule. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Conditional Formatting | New Rule... ...or select Conditional Formatting | Manage Rules... and click the New Rule... button in the invoked Conditional Formatting Rules Manager. In the invoked New Formatting Rule dialog, select the Format cells based on their values type from the Select a Rule Type list. In the Edit Rule Description section, select Icon Sets from the Format style: list. You can select the whole icon set in the Icon Style list or select each icon individually in the Icon section. Check Show Icon Only box to disable showing cell values. To show icons in the reverse order, click Reverse Icon Order button. Select the minimum and maximum threshold type and change values if necessary in the corresponding Value boxes. The resulting rule is shown in the Display each icon according to these rules: section. Edit the Conditional Formatting Rule You can modify existing conditional formatting rules by doing the following: On the Home tab, in the Styles group, click Conditional Formatting | Manage Rules... In the invoked Conditional Formatting Rules Manager, select the part of the document whose formatting rules should be displayed by selecting one of the available areas from the Show formatting rules for: drop-down list. To edit the desired rule, select it within the list and click Edit Rule... button. To apply the selected formatting rule to another cell range, type the cell reference in the Applies to column cell or select the cell range directly in the worksheet by clicking the Collapse Dialog button. The formatting rules are shown in order of precedence. A new formatting rule is automatically added to the top of the list and has the highest precedence. To change the precedence of a desired formatting rule, use Up and Down buttons. You can disable applying the formatting rules lower in precedence if the current rule condition is true. To do that, check the Stop if True box. Note that this options is unavailable for the rules that format cells using data bars, color scales or icon sets. Clear Conditional Formatting Rules To delete a conditional formatting rule, do one of the following: Select the range that contains the conditional formatting rules you wish to clear. On the Home tab, in the Styles group, select Conditional Formatting | Clear Rules | Clear Rules from Selected Cells to delete the rules applied to the selected range.

Charts display data series visually to make data interpretation easier, and show the relationship between different data series. To create a chart, click the chart type you wish to insert in the Charts group within the Insert tab. The following chart types are currently available in the Spreadsheet: Column Charts Column charts are used to display series as sets of vertical bars (or columns) that are grouped by category. The bar lengths are proportional to the values that they represent. Column charts are typically used to compare values in different categories. Some column graphs display series as individual columns, grouped by category, and others show columns divided into subparts to show a cumulative effect (stacked column graphs). You can select column charts of different shapes, such as cylinder, cone or pyramid. Line Charts Line charts display information as a series of data points connected by line segments. This chart type is useful when you need to show trends for several series on the same diagram, and to compare values of several series for the same point argument. Pie Charts Pie and doughnut charts are used to compare the percentage values of different point arguments in the same series. These charts may be useful to determine which point value is the most significant, or which values in the point series are the most significant. A doughnut chart is functionally identical to a pie chart. The main difference is the shape of the doughnut chart, and that it can contain more than one data series. Bar Charts Bar charts are identical to column charts with one exception: bar charts use horizontal bars instead of vertical bars to compare values across categories. Some bar graphs display series as individual bars grouped by category, and others show bars divided into subparts to show a cumulative effect (stacked bar graphs). You can select bar charts of different shapes, such as cylinder, cone or pyramid. Area Charts Area charts display series as filled areas in a diagram, with each data point displayed as a peak or valley in the area. This chart type is useful when you need to show trends for several series on the same diagram, and also show the relationship of the parts to the whole. The area chart is based on the line chart, with the area below the plotted line filled with color. Scatter Charts Scatter charts are used to plot data points on the horizontal and vertical axis to show the relationship between two sets of data. This chart type combines data values into single data points and displays them in uneven intervals (or clusters). Bubble charts allow you to visually represent data that has a third dimension, expressed in the bubble's size. You map two dimensions along the horizontal and vertical axes, and then the third dimension is displayed as a filled circle at the data point. Stock Charts Stock charts are used to show variation in stock prices over the course of a day. In the High-Low-Close chart type, the High and Low prices are represented by the top and bottom values of the vertical line that is shown at each point, and the Close prices are represented by the right tick marks. In the Open-High-Low-Close chart type, the High and Low prices are shown in the same way as in the High-Low-Close charts, but the Open and Close prices are represented by the bottom and top borders of a rectangle. If the stock closes higher than its opening price, the rectangle is hollow. And if the stock closes lower than its opening price, the rectangle is filled. Radar Charts Radar charts are used when it is necessary to display series as an area on a circular grid that has multiple axes along which data can be plotted, so values are shown relative to a center point."

Select the Summary below data check box to display a summary row below detail rows in each group. Otherwise, the summary row will be displayed at the top of the group. Since subtotals are specified, you can change the SUBTOTAL function directly in the cell or formula bar to ignore values in the collapsed groups. To do this, add 100 to the first numeric function's argument, which specifies the code of the function used in calculating subtotals. In this case, the hidden values in the collapsed group will not be taken into account during calculations. To remove subtotals, select a cell in the subtotaled range, invoke the Subtotal dialog and click the Remove All button."

Invoke the Data Validation dialog. On the Settings tab, in the Allow list, select the Custom item. In the Formula box, enter a formula you wish to use as a validation criterion. Note that this formula should return a logical value: TRUE for valid values and FALSE for incorrect values. Your formula may also contain cell references, so that you can calculate the allowable values based on the content of other cells. For example, to restrict data entry for an Employee ID to a five-digit number, use the following formula: =AND(ISNUMBER(B3),LEN(B3)=5). Click OK to close the dialog and apply the specified validation criterion. Create an Input Message Once you apply data validation to cells, you can create an input message, which represents a descriptive message explaining what values can be entered into validated cells. Each time a validated cell is selected, a yellow text box appears near the cell displaying the input message. To create an input message, do the following. Invoke the Data Validation dialog. Switch to the Input Message tab. Verify that the Show input message when cell is selected check box is selected. Specify the message title in the Title box, and enter the detailed message text in the Input Message box. Click OK to close the dialog and add the specified input message to validated cells. Create an Error Message In addition to an input message, you can also specify an error message that will be displayed when a user enters an incorrect value into a validated cell. There are three types of error messages. Stop - specifies that users are not allowed to enter invalid data in a validated cell. The Stop message contains two buttons: the Retry button enables users to edit the invalid entry, while the Cancel button rejects it and rolls back to the previous cell value. Warning - allows users to enter an incorrect value in a validated cell, but warns them that the specified value is invalid. The Warning message contains three buttons: clicking Yes allows users to accept the invalid value, No enables them to edit the invalid entry, and Cancel rolls back to the previous cell value. Information - informs users that they entered an incorrect value and allows them to accept this value by clicking OK, or reject it by clicking Cancel. Unless you specify the error message, the Spreadsheet will use the Stop error alert with the default text. To customize the error text and provide other users with a more informative message, do the following. Invoke the Data Validation dialog. Switch to the Error Alert tab. Verify that the Show error alert after invalid data is entered check box is selected. Select the type of the error message in the Style list. Specify the caption for the error alert window in the Title box, and enter the error description in the Error Message box. Click OK to close the dialog. Note that if you use error messages that do not prevent the entry of incorrect values (Warning or Information), you can identify invalid data in your document by displaying validation circles. Circle Invalid Data The Spreadsheet allows you to highlight invalid values entered into validated cells. To do this, on the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation | Circle Invalid Data. As a result, red circles will appear around cells containing incorrect values. Once you identified invalid values, you can hide validation circles again. Do one of the following. Enter a value that meets the validation criterion in the cell. In this case, the validation circle will disappear automatically. On the Data tab, in the Data Tools group, click Data Validation | Clear Validation Circles. Remove Data Validation To remove data validation criteria, perform the steps below. Select the cells which you wish to stop validating. Tip To quickly select all cells to which data validation is applied, on the Home tab, in the Editing group, click Find & Select | Data Validation. Invoke the Data Validation dialog. Do one of the following. If you are prompted to erase current validation settings and continue, click OK, and then click OK in the invoked Data Validation dialog.

    "keywords": "Cell References The A1 Reference Style If you want to change data in a worksheet without changing formulas that use this data for evaluation, you can use cell references. A cell reference defines cell location in a worksheet. It is a combination of column letters (A, B, C, etc.) and row numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). For example, A1 refers to a cell at the intersection of column A and row 1. To add values in cells A1 and A2, and divide the result by the value in cell A3, type the following formula (use parentheses to determine the order of operations): =(A1+A2)/A3 You can also use a reference to a cell located in another worksheet. For example, to multiply a value in cell B1 by the value in cell B1 in Sheet 2, enter the following formula: =B1*Sheet2!B1 To prevent data from changing when the formula is copied, use the absolute reference. Absolute references have a dollar sign ($) before column and/or row references. The following example demonstrates how to use a constant value in cell B1 in calculations: =A1*$B$1 The R1C1 Reference Style The Spreadsheet supports the R1C1 reference style where both rows and columns are labeled with numbers. Cell location is indicated by an \"R\" letter followed by a row number and a \"C\" letter followed by a column number. You can use absolute and relative R1C1 references. An absolute R1C1 reference always refers to a cell in a specific location. The example below demonstrates how to create a formula that adds values in cells A1 through A5 using the absolute R1C1 reference style: =SUM(R1C1:R5C1) A relative R1C1 reference refers to a cell location in relation to an active cell. The image below illustrates a relative reference to a cell one row above and one column to the left of the active cell. The following example demonstrates how to create a formula that adds values in cell range A1:A5 using the relative R1C1 reference style in cell B1: =SUM(RC[-1]:R[4]C[-1])"

    "title": "Defined Names | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Defined Names The Spreadsheet allows you to define a descriptive name for an individual cell, cell range, function, or constant value to make it easier to understand the information contained in worksheet formulas. Defined Name Overview Defined Name Scope Syntax Rules for Names Create a Name Using the Name Box Create a Name Using the New Name Dialog Create Names from Selection Mange Names Using the Name Manager Dialog Use Names in Formulas Delete Names Defined Name Overview A defined name is a meaningful shorthand name that describes the meaning of an individual cell, cell range, function, or constant value. Each defined name contains the following information. Name Indicates an individual cell, range of cells, formula or constant. Usually, a name explains the purpose of an object to which this name refers, making it easier to find and use this object. When specifying a name, you must take into account special syntax rules. Refers To A string specifying a reference to a cell or cell range, formula or constant associated with the defined name. For example: \"=Sheet1!$D$20\" - refers to the D20 cell located on the Sheet1 worksheet; \"=Sheet1!$A$1:$C$10\" - refers to the A1:C10 range of cells located on the Sheet1 worksheet; \"=SUM(Sheet1!$B$1:$B$10)\" - refers to the formula that calculates the sum of values contained in the B1:B10 range of cells located on the Sheet1 worksheet; \"=10.5\" - refers to a constant value. By default, defined names use absolute cell references, including worksheet names. Comment An explanation or additional information accompanying the defined name. The comment length cannot exceed 255 characters. Defined Name Scope Each defined name has a scope - an area (individual worksheet or entire workbook) where the name is recognized and can be used without qualification. For example, a defined name (cellName) whose scope is the first worksheet of a workbook (Sheet1) is recognized without qualification in this worksheet only (e.g., =5+cellName). To use this defined name in other worksheets, precede it with the name of the worksheet to which the defined name belongs (e.g., \"=5+Sheet1!cellName\"). If the scope of a defined name (cellName_global) is an entire workbook, this name is recognized in any worksheet of this workbook (e.g., \"=5+cellName_global\"). Note Each name must be unique in its scope. If the defined name is not found, the cell that uses this name displays the #NAME? error. Syntax Rules for Names When you create or modify a defined name, follow these rules. Start a name with a letter, an underscore symbol (\"_\") or a backslash (\"\"). Other characters in the name can be letters, numbers, periods and underscore symbols. Note that the single letters \"C\", \"c\", \"R\", or \"r\" cannot be used as defined names. A name cannot contain a cell reference (for example, \"A1\", \"$M$15\", etc.). A name cannot contain spaces (use underscore symbols and periods to separate individual words in a name). A name cannot be an empty string. The length of a name cannot exceed 255 characters. Names are case-insensitive, so that you are not allowed to create the Products and PRODUCTS names in one scope. Create a Name Using the Name Box Select a cell or a range of cells for which you wish to define a name. Type the name you want to use to refer to the selection in the Name Box located to the left of the Formula Bar. Press ENTER. Now you can quickly select the defined cell range by its name. To do this, click the drop-down arrow to the right side of the Name Box, and select the required name from the drop-down list. Create a Name Using the New Name Dialog The New Name dialog gives you more flexibility for naming parts of your document. Using this dialog, you can name cell ranges, formulas and constants, and provide additional information for created names. To invoke the New Name dialog, on the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group, click the Define Name button. In the invoked dialog in the Name box, type a name to be associated with a cell or cell range, formula or constant. In the Scope drop-down list, select the scope of the defined name: specify whether a name should be accessible within an entire workbook or an individual worksheet only. In the Comment box, enter a descriptive text for your defined name (optionally). In the Refers to box, type a cell reference, formula or constant for which you wish to define a name. By default, when you invoke the New Name dialog, the current selection is displayed in the Refers to box. However, you can enter another cell range by selecting it directly in the worksheet. To do this, click the Collapse Dialog button () to minimize the dialog and access the worksheet, select the appropriate cell range, and then click the Expand Dialog button () to restore the dialog's initial state. Click OK to finish creating the name. Create Names from Selection The Create Names from Selection dialog allows you to automatically generate names for rows and columns in the selected range using the row and column labels. To create a name from a selection, do the following. Select a cell range to be named, including the row or column labels to be used for generating names. On the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group, click the Create from Selection button, or press CTRL+SHIFT+F3. In the invoked Create Names from Selection dialog, specify which row (top or bottom) or column (left or right) contains labels that should be used for generating names, and click OK. Note Names generated using this approach do not include the row and column labels and refer only to the cells containing values. Mange Names Using the Name Manager Dialog The Name Manager dialog lists all the defined names specified in a workbook and allows you to create new names, edit and delete existing names. To invoke the Name Manager dialog, on the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group, click the Name Manager button. Create a name To define a new name, at the top of the Name Manager dialog, click the New... button. In the invoked New Name dialog, specify all necessary parameters for a new defined name. Edit a name To modify the existing name, select this name in the Name list, and at the top of the Name Manager dialog click the Edit... button, or double-click the name. In the invoked Edit Name dialog, modify the name itself, change the cell reference, formula or constant to which the name refers, or enter a new comment. Only the scope of the defined name cannot be changed. If you wish to modify only the current reference for a name, you can do it directly in the Name Manager dialog. To do this, select the desired name in the Name list and type a new value in the Refers to box, or... ... click the Collapse Dialog button () and select the desired range directly in the worksheet. Use Names in Formulas To insert an existing defined name into a formula, type the required name directly in the formula or select it from the Use in Formula list on the Formulas tab in the Defined Names group. Delete Names To remove a defined name, do the following. On the Formulas tab, in the Defined Names group, click the Name Manager button. In the invoked Name Manager dialog, select the name you wish to delete. Click the Delete button, or press DELETE."

    "keywords": "Using Functions in Formulas The Spreadsheet provides the capability to use a set of predefined functions in formulas to perform simple or complex calculations. To create a formula containing functions, follow the instructions below. Click the cell in which you want to insert the formula. Type the equal sign \"=\". This is required to interpret the cell content as a formula. Skip this action if you insert the function in a cell which already contains a formula. Type the function's name, or insert the required function from the Function Library. Enter the arguments between the function's parentheses. Press ENTER. The result appears in the cell in which you inserted the formula. Insert a Function If you do not remember the name of the function you want to use, you can insert the desired function quickly using one of the following approaches. Using the Function Library group On the Formulas tab, in the Function Library group, click the button corresponding to the category to which your function belongs, and select this function from the button's drop-down list. Tip Frequently used functions such as Sum, Average, Count Numbers, Max and Min are also listed under the AutoSum button on the Home tab in the Editing group. For example, if you wish to add all numbers in the range E4:E8, in the Function Library group, select the SUM function from the AutoSum (or Math & Trig) button's drop-down list. Type \"E4:E8\" in the function's parentheses, or select the cell range directly in the worksheet, and press ENTER. Using the Insert Function dialog To invoke the Insert Function dialog, click the Insert Function button on the Formula Bar, or press SHIFT+F3. At the top of the dialog, select a category to which the desired function belongs, and then select this function in the sorted list below. Note that at the bottom of the dialog, the selected function's syntax and description are shown. Click OK. In the invoked Function Arguments dialog, enter the required function's arguments (that are marked in bold font) in the corresponding editors. A function argument can be a data value, cell reference, defined name, another function, etc. If your function uses a cell reference as an argument, you can select the desired cell range directly in the worksheet. To do this, click the Collapse Dialog button () to the right of the argument editor (to minimize the dialog and access the worksheet), select the appropriate cell range, and then click the Expand Dialog button () to restore the dialog's initial state and continue specifying other function arguments. After all the function's arguments are specified, click OK to finish building your formula and see the calculated result in the cell. Note If you start the formula with a function, the Spreadsheet automatically adds the equal sign to your formula. Nested functions You can create a formula with a function that uses another function as one of the arguments. A function that is used as an argument is called a nested function. A formula can contain up to 64 levels of nesting. Examples of formulas with nested functions are detailed in the table below. Formula Description =ROUND(SUM(A1:A5),2) Round the sum of the values contained in the cell range A1:A5 to two decimal places. =SQRT(AVERAGE(A1:A5)) Returns the square root of the average value of the numbers in the cell range A1:A5. =IF(A5<1000, POWER(A5,2)) Square the value in cell A5 if it is less than 1000."

    "keywords": "Mail Merge Overview The Spreadsheet supports the Mail Merge functionality, which allows you to automatically generate a set of documents based on a common template, and include unique data values retrieved from a data source in each document. Use mail merge to generate personalized letters and a variety of professional reports. Add a Data Source Create a Template Generate a Merged Document Add a Data Source To perform a mail merge, you need a template and a data source from which the data is retrieved. You can specify a data source at runtime using the Data Source Wizard. Once created, the data source configuration will be stored in the XLS/XLSX spreadsheet file, so there is no need to re-configure the data source again. To invoke the wizard, click Add Data Source in the External Data Sources group of the Mail Merge tab. The wizard allows you to select the data source type. You can choose between an external database, the Entity Framework, an object data source or an Excel workbook. For more information on data source configuration, review the following documents: Data Source Wizard Query Builder Parameters Panel Create a Template A template is a workbook with one worksheet containing mail merge fields that will be filled with unique data values from a bound data source. As a rule, a template includes detail, header and footer ranges that reflect the structure of a merged document. To highlight template ranges, on the Mail Merge tab, in the Design group, click the Mail Merge Design View button. A detail range contains information from a data source. To create a detail range, select the range of the required size and do one of the following: On the Mail Merge tab, in the Template Ranges group, click the Detail button. Assign the \"DETAILRANGE\" defined name to the selected range. A detail range includes mail merge fields. Real data values retrieved from a data source will be displayed in a merged document instead of these fields. To create a mail merge field, use the FIELD function. Function Syntax Description FIELD FIELD(\"data_field_name\") Retrieves a data value from the corresponding field of a data source. A mail merge field is displayed as the name of the specified data field enclosed in square brackets. If a mail merge field is used in a cell formula as one of its elements, the entire formula is displayed in the cell. You can also create a multi-level report by adding nested levels within a detail range. To create the next data level, select a range within an existing detail range, and then click Master-Detail | Detail Level in the Template Ranges group. Click Master-Detail | Data Member to invoke the Data Member dialog and bind the specified detail level to a data member from a data source. Header and footer ranges are displayed above and below all detail ranges in the resulting worksheet if all data records are merged into a single worksheet. In other mail merge modes, the header and footer are repeated for each detail range. To create a header or footer range, select the range you wish to use as a header or footer, and do one of the following: On the Mail Merge tab, in the Template Ranges group, click the Header or Footer button. Assign the \"HEADERRANGE\" or \"FOOTERRANGE\" defined name to the selected range. Note that you can create a header or footer range only if the template already contains a detail range. If you do not set a detail range, the entire template will be copied for each record of the data source. At the template creation stage, you can access the range into which the specified cell in a template will be expanded after a mail merge is performed. To do this, use the RANGE function. Function Syntax Description RANGE RANGE(abs_cell_reference) Obtains the specified range of a merged document. If you no longer wish to use the specified range as a detail range, header or footer, you can reset it by clicking the Reset button. Generate a Merged Document A mail merge supports three modes for generating a resulting document, as listed in the table below: Mode Description Multiple Documents Inserts the merged range for each record of the data source into a separate workbook. Multiple Sheets Inserts the merged range for each record of the data source into a separate worksheet of a single document. Single Sheet Inserts all merged ranges into a single worksheet, retaining the structure of the template document.

To invoke this menu, right-click the column to which a formatting rule should be applied and select Conditional Formatting. Available format rules are displayed when expanding the Conditional Formatting menu. Different options are supported for different columns (depending on the type of data a clicked column displays). Highlighting Cells that Meet a Specific Condition Choose the Highlight Cell Rules menu item. Select the condition type. You can use one of the predefined conditions (the Greater Than..., Less Than.., Between... and Equal To... menu items), provide a custom condition (the Custom Condition.. item) or format cells that contain the specified text (Text that Contains...) or refer to a certain date interval(s) (A Date Occurring...). Based on the selected condition type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. You need to either enter a constant to be compared with the column's values, or select desired check boxes related to dates, or construct a custom condition in the dedicated editor. After that, choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Top or Bottom Cell Values Choose the Top/Bottom Rules menu item. Select the rule type. You can highlight cells that contain the highest or lowest values (the Top 10%..., Bottom 10%..., Top 10 Items... and Bottom 10 Items... menu items), and values that are above or below the column's average (Above Average and Below Average). According to the selected rule type, an appropriate dialog window is invoked. Enter a cutoff value (where required), choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Unique or Duplicate Cell Values Choose the Unique/Duplicate Rules menu item. Select the rule type. In the invoked dialog window, choose a format style in the dropdown list, and click the OK button. To apply formatting to an entire row instead of a single cell, select the corresponding check box. Highlighting Cells Using Data Bars A data bar fills a cell according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest column values. A longer bar corresponds to a higher value, and a shorter bar corresponds to a lower value. To apply a data bar format, do the following: Choose the Data Bars menu item. Select the bar style format. Solid bars and bars with gradient fills are available in various colors. Applying Color Scales This format shows data distribution and variation using color scales. A cell is filled with the background color that is calculated according to the ratio of the cell's value to the highest and smallest column values. A two-color scale specifies two colors, which represent the minimum and maximum column values. Cell values residing between the minimum and maximum values are painted using a shade of these colors. A three-color scale additionally defines a color for the middle value and so, uses a gradation of three colors. Choose the Color Scales menu item. Select one of the predefined two or three-color scales. Highlighting Cells Using Predefined Icons Icon sets allow you to classify column values into several ranges separated by threshold values, and display a specific icon in a column cell according to the range to which this cell value belongs. In the Positive/Negative group, the available icon sets divide column values into three ranges: positive values, negative values and values equal to zero. Other icon sets divide column values into three, four or five ranges, displaying a specific icon for each range. If an icon set contains three icons, the ranges are as follows: [0%-33%), [33%-67%) and [67%-100%], where 0% corresponds to the smallest column value and 100% corresponds to the largest column value. The icon sets with four icons classify column values into four ranges: [0%-25%), [25%-50%), [50%-75%) and [75%-100%]. For the icon sets that contain five icons, the target ranges are: [0%-20%), [20%-40%), [40%-60%), [60%-80%) and [80%-100%]. Choose the Icon Sets menu item. Select one of the predefined icon sets. Deleting Rules If you have already applied one or more rules to columns, the additional Clear Rules item is displayed at the second level of the Conditional Formatting menu. You can do one of the following. To delete conditional formatting rules from the target column, click the Clear Rules from This Column menu item. If the column has no rules applied to it, this item is not shown. or To delete formatting rules from all columns, click the Clear Rules from All Columns menu item ."

Click the Clear button. Click the clear button that is displayed within the editor when the editor is focused and is not empty. Search syntax In its simplest form, a search criterion consists of a single word. However, the search panel allows you to create composite criteria. Mask: criterion Example: carlos Example description: selects records that contain the \"carlos\" string in any search column. Mask: column:criterion Example: city:san You can search against a specific column by preceding a search string with the column's caption and a colon character. Instead of the complete caption, it is possible to use the initial characters of the caption. A search will be performed against the first column whose name starts with the specified substring. If you want to search against a column whose caption contains space characters, specify the column's display caption in quotation marks. If the search string contains multiple conditions separated by space characters, and at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, only records that match all of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain \"san\" in the column that starts with \"city\". Mask: criterion1 criterion2 Example: carlos venezuela Option 1 Option 2 Based on conditions provided by your application vendor, the search panel can search words separated by space characters in one of the following ways. Option AND Only records that match all of the conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain both \"carlos\" AND \"venezuela\" strings in any search column. Option OR If there is no column specification, records that match at least one of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the OR logical operator). If at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, only records that match all of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain either \"carlos\" OR \"venezuela\" strings in any search column. Mask: \"criterion with spaces\" Example: \"maria anders\" If you want to search for a string containing a space character, specify this string in quotation marks. Example description: selects records that contain \"maria anders\" in any search column. Mask: criterion1 -criterion2 Example: maria -anders Precede a condition with \"-\" to exclude records that match this condition from the resulting set. There should be no space between the \"-\" sign and the condition. Example description: selects records that contain \"maria\", excluding records that contain \"anders\". Mask: criterion1 +criterion2 Example: Spain +Madrid Precede a condition with \"+\" to display only records that match this condition. The \"+\" specifier allows you to implement the logical AND operator. There should be no space character between the \"+\" sign and the condition. Example description: selects records that contain both \"Spain\" AND \"Madrid\" in search columns."

Search syntax In its simplest form, a search criterion consists of a single word. However, the search panel allows you to create composite criteria. Mask: criterion maria Example description: selects records that contain the \"maria\" string in any search column. Mask: column:criterion contact:maria You can search against a specific column by preceding a search string with the column's caption plus a colon character. Instead of the complete caption, it is possible to use the initial characters of the caption. A search will be performed against the first column whose name starts with the specified substring. If you want to search against a column whose caption contains space characters, specify the column's display caption in quotation marks. If the search string contains multiple conditions separated by space characters, and at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, only records that match all of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain \"maria\" in the column that starts with \"contact\". Mask: criterion1 criretion2 maria anders Option AND Option OR Based on conditions provided by your application vendor, the search panel can search words separated by space characters in one of the following ways. Option AND Only records that match all of the conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain both \"maria\" AND \"anders\" strings in any search column. Option OR If there is no column specification, records that match at least one of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the OR logical operator). If at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, only records that match all of these conditions are shown (i.e., the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain either \"maria\" OR \"anders\" strings in any search column. Mask: \"criterion with spaces\" \"maria anders\" If you want to search for a string containing a space character, specify this string in quotation marks. Example description: selects records that contain \"maria anders\" in any search column. Mask: criterion1 -criterion2 maria -anders Precede a condition with \"-\" to exclude records that match this condition from the result set. There should be no space between the \"-\" sign and the condition. Example description: selects records that contain \"maria\", excluding records that contain \"anders\". Mask: criterion1 +criterion2 maria +sweden Precede a condition with \"+\" to display only records that match this condition. The \"+\" specifier allows you to implement the logical AND operator.

    "keywords": "Edit an Appointment Context Menu There are two ways to invoke an appointment's context menu: Right-click an appointment. Use a smart tag. To invoke a smart tag, click on an appointment and wait for the smart tag to appear. Then, click on the smart tag to invoke the context menu. Note This approach may be useful if you use a web browser (for example, Opera) and right-clicking on an appointment does not invoke a Scheduler control's context menu. This context menu contains items that allow you to modify certain appointment properties. For example, you can use the Show Time As submenu to change an appointment's status. If you select the Label As menu item, you can choose another label for the current appointment from the list of available label types. This menu also contains the Open item which allows you to invoke the appointment's Edit Appointment dialog. Note The appointment's context menu can also contain the Edit Series and Restore Default State menu items. This means that an appointment is a part of a recurring appointment series. See Make a Series of Recurring Appointments for more information. Edit Appointment Dialog To invoke the Edit Appointment dialog, select Open in an appointment's context menu. This dialog's usual appearance is illustrated below. The Edit Appointment dialog allows you to edit the following appointment properties: Subject An appointment's subject. This text is displayed within an appointment to identify it. Location Information about where an appointment takes place. This text is displayed within the appointment in parentheses after the subject text. Label Used for at-a-glance appointment identification. It is displayed in the Scheduler as a background color of the rectangle that represents the appointment. Start time and End time An appointment's start/end date and time. Show time as Indicates an appointment's availability status. It is displayed as a strip on the appointment rectangle's left side. The strip is colored according to the status type. All day event Transforms an appointment into an all-day event which always lasts an entire day (or several days). Note that if this property is true, the Start and End properties' real-time values are ignored, and instead, the appointment starts at 0:00 on the Start date and ends at 24:00 on the End date. Resource A resource that is assigned to an appointment. This resource can be used to group appointments by resources. Reminder Allows you to set a reminder that is responsible for sending notifications at a specified period before an appointment's start time. Refer to Manage Reminders for more details. Description The text box located below the Resource and Reminder options. This text box allows you to enter a description that is shown within an appointment in Day View or Work Week View. Recurrence Expands the Recurrence section that specifies the appointment's recurrence pattern. See Make a Series of Recurring Appointments for more information. In-place Editor Double-click an appointment to invoke its In-place Editor which allows you to edit an appointment's Subject. Note that if you need to edit other appointment properties, you can invoke the Edit Appointment dialog via the Open Appointment Editing Form button. Mouse Operations To select an appointment, click it with the left mouse button. To select several appointments, press and hold the Ctrl key and then click appointments with the left mouse button. Drag-and-drop operations enable you to change an appointment's time interval if an appointment is moved along a time cell area. If you press Esc before dropping an appointment, all changes are canceled, and the appointment returns to its original location. If you press and hold the Ctrl key and click and drag an appointment (or several appointments), you create appointment copy(s) when the mouse button is released. You can also change an appointment's type to all-day and vice-versa by dragging the appointment between the all-day area and time cells. In grouped views, when different columns represent different resources, dragging the appointment to another column automatically changes the associated resource."

    "keywords": "Make a Series of Recurring Appointments What is a Recurring Appointment? The Scheduler control supports simple (non-recurring) or recurring appointments. Non-recurring appointments occur only once at a specified time interval. Recurring appointments occur many times at the same time interval on different dates. Recurring appointments are created as a series of appointments using the recurrence pattern and identified by the recurrence sign. Recurrence Pattern The recurrence pattern contains information on appointment recurrence (the recurrence series's start date and time and a rule according to which a series is repeated). You can create and edit an appointment's recurrence pattern in the standard Edit Appointment dialog by selecting the Recurrence check box. The image below illustrates the usual appearance of the Edit Appointment dialog's recurrence section. In this dialog, you can specify different elements' values to define the recurrence behavior. Frequency is the recurrence pattern's base element. It specifies how often the corresponding appointments occur: Daily, Weekly, Monthly or Yearly. You can define periodicity for each frequency type - the time interval in which the recurrence's frequency is applied. For instance, if you have specified that appointments occur Daily, you can also specify whether appointments repeat every couple of days or every weekday. For the Monthly appointment frequency, you can specify for how many weeks and on which weekdays an appointment recurs. You can also specify when an appointment's recurrence must end. If an appointment is recurring, its context menu contains the Edit Series item. Clicking this item invokes the Edit Appointment dialog for editing the recurrence pattern. If you use the context menu's Open item to invoke the Edit Appointment dialog, you can edit only the current appointment to avoid raising exceptions. Exceptions When you modify an occurrence's (an appointment that belongs to a recurring appointment series) properties, it is called an Exception. Such appointments are marked with the crossed recurrence sign. You can delete one or several occurrences in the recurrence chain. A deleted occurrence is a type of recurrence pattern Exception, and the SchedulerControl does not visualize it. To replace an exception with a regular occurrence and discard all modifications, right-click the exception and click on the Restore Default State item in the invoked context menu. Editing an appointment series's recurrence pattern (Edit Series context menu item) resets the recurrence chain, and restores all the exceptions to their default state. A warning is displayed before this happens."

Pie Charts Chart Subtypes: 2-D Pie Charts: Pie Exploded Pie 3-D Pie Charts: Pie in 3-D Exploded Pie in 3-D Doughnut Charts: Doughnut Exploded Doughnut Pie and doughnut charts are used to compare the percentage values of different point arguments in the same series. These charts may be useful to determine which point value is the most significant, or which values in the point series are the most significant. A doughnut chart is functionally identical to a pie chart. The main difference is the shape of the doughnut chart, and that it can contain more than one data series. Bar Charts Chart Subtypes: 2-D Bar Charts: Clustered Bar Stacked Bar 100% Stacked Bar 3-D Bar Charts: Clustered Bar in 3-D Stacked Bar in 3-D 100% Stacked Bar in 3-D Cylinder Charts: Clustered Horizontal Cylinder Stacked Horizontal Cylinder 100% Stacked Horizontal Cylinder Cone Charts: Clustered Horizontal Cone Stacked Horizontal Cone 100% Stacked Horizontal Cone Pyramid Charts: Clustered Horizontal Pyramid Stacked Horizontal Pyramid 100% Stacked Horizontal Pyramid Bar charts are identical to column charts with one exception: bar charts use horizontal bars instead of vertical bars to compare values across categories. Some bar graphs display series as individual bars grouped by category, and others show bars divided into subparts to show a cumulative effect (stacked bar graphs). You can select bar charts of different shapes, such as cylinder, cone or pyramid. Area Charts Chart Subtypes: 2-D Area Charts: Area Stacked Area 100% Stacked Area 3-D Area Charts: 3-D Area Stacked Area in 3-D 100% Stacked Area in 3-D Area charts display series as filled areas in a diagram, with each data point displayed as a peak or valley in the area. This chart type is useful when you need to show trends for several series on the same diagram, and also show the relationship of the parts to the whole. The area chart is based on the line chart, with the area below the plotted line filled with color. Scatter Charts Chart Subtypes: Scatter Charts: Scatter with only Markers Scatter with Smooth Lines and Markers Scatter with Smooth Lines Scatter with Straight Lines and Markers Scatter with Straight Lines Bubble Charts: Bubble Bubble with a 3-D Effect Scatter charts are used to plot data points on the horizontal and vertical axis to show the relationship between two sets of data. This chart type combines data values into single data points and displays them in uneven intervals (or clusters). Bubble charts allow you to visually represent data that has a third dimension, expressed in the bubble's size. You map two dimensions along the horizontal and vertical axes, and then the third dimension is displayed as a filled circle at the data point. Stock Charts Chart Subtypes: Stock Charts: High-Low-Close Open-High-Low-Close Stock charts are used to show variation in stock prices over the course of a day. In the High-Low-Close chart type, the High and Low prices are represented by the top and bottom values of the vertical line that is shown at each point, and the Close prices are represented by the right tick marks. In the Open-High-Low-Close chart type, the High and Low prices are shown in the same way as in the High-Low-Close charts, but the Open and Close prices are represented by the bottom and top borders of a rectangle. If the stock closes higher than its opening price, the rectangle is hollow. And if the stock closes lower than its opening price, the rectangle is filled. Radar Charts Chart Subtypes: Radar Charts: Radar Radar with Markers Filled Radar Radar charts are used when it is necessary to display series as an area on a circular grid that has multiple axes along which data can be plotted, so values are shown relative to a center point."

A cell reference defines cell location in a worksheet. It is a combination of column letters (A, B, C, etc.) and row numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). For example, A1 refers to a cell at the intersection of column A and row 1. To add values in cells A1 and A2, and divide the result by the value in cell A3, type the following formula (use parentheses to determine the order of operations): =(A1+A2)/A3 You can also use a reference to a cell located in another worksheet. For example, to multiply a value in cell B1 by the value in cell B1 in Sheet 2, enter the following formula. =B1*Sheet2!B1 To prevent data from changing when the formula is copied, use the absolute reference. Absolute references have a dollar sign ($) before column and/or row references. The following example demonstrates how to use a constant value in cell B1 in calculations: =A1*$B$1"

Lookup and Reference Functions - used for searching specific data in a worksheet: to look up values in vectors, arrays or references (e.g., LOOKUP or MATCH). Statistical Functions - used for data analysis: to find the average of a list of values (AVERAGE), to evaluate the covariance between two data sets (COVAR), to find the smallest or the largest value in a list of arguments (MAX, MIN), etc. Engineering Functions - used to work with special functions (e.g., BESSELI or BESSELJ), complex numbers (e.g., COMPLEX or IMAGINARY) and various numeral systems (e.g., DEC2BIN or BIN2DEC). Information Functions - used to provide information about the formatting, location or content of cells (e.g., CELL, INFO or ISTEXT). Compatibility Functions - replaced by new functions in Microsoft® Excel® versions 2010 and higher. These functions can be used to provide compatibility with earlier versions of Microsoft® Excel®.

    "keywords": "Using Functions in Formulas The Spreadsheet provides the capability to use a set of predefined functions in formulas to perform simple or complex calculations. To create a formula containing functions, follow the instructions below. Click the cell in which you want to insert the formula. Type the equal sign \"=\". This is required to interpret the cell content as a formula. Skip this action if you insert the function in a cell which already contains a formula. Type the function's name, or insert the required function from the Function Library. Enter the arguments between the function's parentheses. Press ENTER. The result appears in the cell in which you inserted the formula. Insert a Function If you do not remember the name of the function you want to use, you can insert the desired function quickly using the Function Library group within the Formulas tab. On the Formulas tab, in the Function Library group, click the button corresponding to the category to which your function belongs, and select this function from the button's drop-down list. Tip Frequently used functions such as Sum, Average, Count Numbers, Max and Min are also listed under the AutoSum button on the Home tab in the Editing group. For example, if you wish to add all numbers in the range E4:E8, in the Function Library group, select the SUM function from the AutoSum (or Math & Trig) button's drop-down list. Type \"E4:E8\" in the function's parentheses or select the cell range directly in the worksheet, and press ENTER. Note If you start the formula with a function, the Spreadsheet automatically adds the equal sign to your formula. Nested functions You can create a formula with a function that uses another function as one of the arguments. A function that is used as an argument is called a nested function. A formula can contain up to 64 levels of nesting. Examples of formulas with nested functions are detailed in the table below. Formula Description =ROUND(SUM(A1:A5),2) Round the sum of the values contained in the cell range A1:A5 to two decimal places. =SQRT(AVERAGE(A1:A5)) Returns the square root of the average value of the numbers in the cell range A1:A5. =IF(A5<1000, POWER(A5,2)) Square the value in cell A5 if it is less than 1000."

However, the search panel allows creating composite criteria. Mask: criterion maria Example description: selects records that contain the \"maria\" string in any search column. Mask: column:criterion contact:maria You can search against a specific column by preceding a search string with the column's caption plus a colon character. Instead of the complete caption, it is possible to use the caption's initial characters to perform a search against the first column whose name starts with the specified substring. To search against a column whose caption contains space characters, specify the column's display caption in quotation marks. If the search string contains multiple conditions separated by space characters, and at least one condition defines a search against a specific column, the tree list displays only records that match all of these conditions (the AND logical operator combines conditions). Example description: selects records that contain \"maria\" in the column that starts with \"contact\".

Option AND Only records that match all of the conditions are shown (that is, the conditions are combined by the AND logical operator). Example description: selects records that contain both \"maria\" AND \"anders\" strings in any search column. Option OR If there is no column specification, the tree list displays records that match at least one of these conditions (the OR logical operator combines the conditions).

The example below is based on the following report: This report displays products that are grouped by the CategoryName field. The following image illustrates the resulting report with a hierarchical Document Map. Clicking any bookmark navigates the Print Preview to the document section containing the associated element. Use the following steps to generate a Document Map in your grouped report: Select the label placed in the Group Header band and switch to the Property Grid's Miscellaneous tab. Click the Bookmark property's marker and select the Bookmark Expression item. In the invoked Expression Editor, select the CategoryName data field. In the legacy binding mode (if the Property Grid does not provide the Bookmark Expression item), you can specify this property in the Property Grid's Data Bindings category. In the same way, select the label in the Detail band and bind its Bookmark property to the ProductName data field. Most of the reporting controls (for example, Table, TableCell, CheckBox, etc.) supports the Bookmark property. Set the same label's Parent Bookmark property to the label in the group band. This arranges bookmarks into a parent-child structure reflecting the report elements' hierarchy in the Document Map. Note Avoid cyclic bookmarks that occur when you assign two bookmarks as parents to each other. In this scenario, an exception raises when you attempt to create the report document. Select the report itself and assign text to its Bookmark property to determine the root node's caption in the Document Map. The root bookmark displays the report name if you do not specify this property. Note Duplicated bookmarks are suppressed to prevent adding multiple bookmarks with the same name to a final document. You can disable the report's Bookmark Duplicate Suppress property to allow duplicated bookmarks."

You can add a cross-reference for a report control by setting the following properties: Set the Navigation Target property to _self to specify that the link is in the same document. Set the Navigation URL property to the target control's Name property value. In this case, the control behaves like a link meaning that the cursor automatically changes to a hand in a report's preview when hovering the control. You can make a control resemble a link by specifying its appearance properties (for example, change the text's color to blue and underline it). The link uses the first occurrence if there are multiple instances of an object marked as a link's target. Tip A report's cross-references are preserved when exporting it to PDF. Add Hyperlinks A hyperlink means that a link's target is outside the report. You can use any control as a link by setting the Navigation Url property to the required target document's URL.

Note The Report Designer's Report Wizard provides the JSON option if the application has a reference to the open-source Newtonsoft.Json library for .NET Framework projects. The next wizard page allows you to specify a Web Service Endpoint, a filename, or a string with JSON data. In this example, the JSON data is obtained from a JSON sample data location. Choose Web Service Endpoint and specify the endpoint data. Choose JSON File and specify the JSON file location. Choose JSON String and provide the JSON data string. If you choose the Web Service Endpoint option, you can configure a web service endpoint, URI path parameters, query parameters, and header parameters. 4.1. Specify path parameters and query parameters. You can enable the new parameter's Expression property and use expressions to set path parameter and query parameter values.

Select New Report Parameter from the Value property's drop-down list, configure the report parameter in the invoked Report Parameter dialog, and click OK. Note The Data Source Wizard sends a request to the endpoint with the specified parameters to populate the data source and build the data source schema. Ensure that the parameters are always set to the values that the endpoint expects. Otherwise, the Data Source Wizard generates an error on the next steps. For instance, if a user specifies the name of a JSON file in a parameter, specify the default file name in order to avoid the File Not Found error. Path parameters and query parameters are included in endpoint requests in the same order as they are listed. Move a parameter up or down in the list to change its position in endpoint requests. The Resulting URI read-only field shows how the resulting JSON URI looks. Click Next to proceed to the Wizard's next page. 4.2. Configure the Basic HTTP Authentication credentials and HTTP header parameters. Use the same steps as in P.4.1. above to configure a header parameter. 4.3. Choose whether to save the created connection string to the application's configuration file. If not, the connection parameters are saved to the report's definition. Tip If the path parameters, query parameters, and header parameters you specified do not contain sensitive data, you can save them along with the connection parameters. Otherwise, the path parameters, query parameters, and header parameters are used once to retrieve JSON data to an object in memory. This object is accessible until you close the Report Designer. On the next page, the wizard shows the structure of your JSON data. You can choose whether to include all records (root) or a subset of them to the datasource’s final set of records. Uncheck data fields that you do not want to include to your report. Assign a title to a field’s Field Display Name column if you want to use this title as a default field name. The JSON Data Source Wizard analyzes only the first 100 records to generate field types. If your JSON data contains more than 100 records, you can use all of them for type generation. For this, click the Analyze all records button. After you finish the wizard, it creates the JsonDataSource component. This component retrieves the checked data fields that the selected JSON element includes. The Field List reflects the data source structure. Customize the JSON Data Source Right-click the JsonDataSource component in the Field List or Report Explorer and choose Edit....

    "keywords": "Specify Query Parameters This document provides general information on query parameters and describes common ways of utilizing parametrized SQL queries to filter data at the data source level. Query Parameters Overview A query parameter holds an external value that is inserted into an SQL statement before query execution. This value can be either static or dynamically generated by an associated expression. The query parameter value is inserted into the resulting SQL query string in the \"@QueryParameterName\" placeholder's position. Query parameters are used in the following scenarios: When filtering report data at the data source level using the Query Builder. The Query Builder helps you construct SQL queries when creating a new data-bound report or binding an existing report to an SQL data source, ... or when adding queries to an existing SQL data source or editing existing queries. You can filter the constructed queries using query parameters. Press the Edit Parameters... button to invoke the Query Parameters dialog. Press the Filter... button to invoke the Filter Editor and filter data using the created query parameters. The criteria based on the specified query parameters are added as an SQL statement's WHERE part. When binding a report to a stored procedure provided by an SQL data source. The Report Wizard, as well as the Data Source Wizard, include the Create a query or select a stored procedure page. If you select a stored procedure, the wizard creates a query parameter for each procedure parameter and allows you to configure the query parameters in the next Configure query parameters and preview the result page. You can access query parameters using the Parameters property of the query the report's SqlDataSource component exposes. These parameters include the ones you created within the Query Builder or that were generated for the data source's stored procedure. You can also access the query’s filter string using the Filter String property. This filter string includes the filter that you specified in the Query Builder. You can add new query parameters in the Query Parameters dialog and modify the filter within the Filter Editor. Configure Query Parameters The following properties are available for each query parameter: Name - specifies the parameter's name. Type - specifies the parameter value's data type. Expression - determines whether the actual parameter value is static or generated dynamically. Value - determines the query parameter's actual value. If the Expression option is enabled, the actual parameter value is produced dynamically by calculating an associated expression. This is useful when you map the query parameter value to the report parameter value. Refer to the next document section for more information. Provide the Query Parameter Value Below, you can see how a value is specified for a query parameter within the Data Source Wizard's page. You can also specify query parameter values in the Report Wizard or the Query Parameters dialog in the same way. Specifying a static value Choose a query parameter's value type and set a static value to the Value property according to the selected type. Providing a dynamic value Activate the Expression checkbox for a parameter. The following three options are used to dynamically calculate the parameter's actual value: Create a complex expression by expanding the Value property's drop-down list and selecting Expression Editor. Construct an expression in the invoked Expression Editor. Map a new report parameter to a query parameter by expanding the Value property's drop-down list and selecting New Report Parameter. Specify report parameter settings in the invoked Report Parameter dialog. Remember to specify the report parameter type according to the type of the corresponding query parameter. Click OK to exit the dialog. Map a report parameter that already exists in a report to a query parameter by expanding the Value property's drop-down list and selecting the parameter you want to use. An appropriate expression string is generated automatically. Pass a Multi-Value Parameter Value to a Query You can map multi-value parameters to query parameters. For instance, the following query selects the orders whose IDs can be found within the values the @OrderID query parameter provides. Pass a Multi-Value Report Parameter Value to a Stored Procedure You cannot pass a multi-value parameter value to a stored procedure directly. Use one of the following expression functions: Use the Join() expression function to convert the array of parameter values to a string if you use MS SQL Server, MySQL or Oracle database systems. Use the CreateTable() expression function to prepare a table using values of several multi-value parameters."

    "keywords": "Invoices This tutorial describes how to create a simple invoice report displaying information about customers and their orders. You can perform similar steps to create various invoice layouts depending on your requirements. Note See the Invoices from Templates topic for information on how to create an invoice report based on a predefined layout. Create a Report and Bind It to Data Create a new report or open an existing one. Click the report's smart tag. In the invoked actions list, expand the drop-down menu for the Data Source property and click Add New DataSource. On the first page of the invoked Data Source Wizard, you can choose the required data source type. Select Microsoft SQL Server and click Next. The following page allows you to specify whether you want to use an existing data connection or create a new one. For this example, select an existing connection and click Next. On the next page, you can choose which tables, views and/or stored procedures to add to the report. Obtain data from two different tables to display information about customers and orders at the same hierarchical level in the report. Click the plus button for the Queries category to create a custom query. In the invoked Query Builder, add the required data tables to a query and join them based on a key column. On the same wizard page, select the data view providing order details for listing products included in each order in the invoice. Click the Manage Relations button to specify a master-detail relationship between the queries. In the invoked dialog, connect the required key columns using drag-and-drop. Click Finish to complete the wizard. After these steps, make sure that an appropriate data member is assigned to the report. Prepare the Master Report Layout Create the master report layout to display basic information about customers and their orders. Switch to the Field List and drop the required data fields onto the Detail band. New controls of appropriate types are automatically created and bound to the corresponding fields. Drop Label controls from the Toolbox onto the band to display static captions for specific data fields. Double-click the added labels one after another and enter the required text. Use the Line control to separate data. Prepare the Detail Report Layout Perform the following steps to create a detail report and construct its layout to show the order details in a tabular form: Create a Detail Report Band by right-clicking the report's surface. In the invoked context menu, select Insert Detail Report, and then, select the master-detail relationship's name. Add dynamic content to the detail report. Go to the Field List, select the data fields while holding down CTRL or SHIFT and drag-and-drop them onto the Detail band. This automatically creates a Table control with table cells bound to the corresponding fields. You should drag-and-drop fields from the category corresponding to the master-detail relationship to correctly generate the detail report's data. Add the Group Header band to the detail report to display captions for table columns. Right-click the detail report, and in the context menu, select Insert Band | GroupHeader. To create column headers, select the same data fields in the Field List and drag-and-drop them onto the Group Header band using the right mouse button. Click the Detail Report band's smart tag, and in the invoked actions list, set the band's Page Break property to After the Band to print each order on a separate page. Create a Calculated Field This section demonstrates how to create a custom field whose values are calculated using a pre-defined expression. Do the following to evaluate an extended price based on the price, quantity and discount values obtained from a database: In the Field List, right-click any item inside the data relationship node, and in the invoked context menu, select Add Calculated Field. Select the created calculated field, and in the Property Grid, change its name to ExtendedPrice. Click the Expression property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Expression Editor, construct the expression based on the UnitPrice, Quantity and Discount fields. You can use the created calculated field as an ordinary data field. Add a cell to a table in the Detail band and drop the calculated field onto this cell. Additionally, create one more table cell in the Group Header for displaying the corresponding caption. Format Data The next step is to specify report elements' value formatting to improve displaying their incoming data. In the master report's Detail band, select controls bound to date fields while holding down CTRL or SHIFT. Switch to the Property Grid and click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Format String Editor, activate the DateTime category and select the format, for example, display dates as a month (name) followed by the day (number) and year (four digits). Select the table cell bound to the Discount data field in the detail report's Detail band and click its smart tag. Click the Format String property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Format String Editor, apply the Percent format. In this case, field values are multiplied by 100 and displayed with a percent symbol. In the detail report's Detail band, select the cells bound to the UnitPrice and ExtendedPrice fields. Invoke the Format String Editor once again and choose the format preset from the Currency category (for instance, c2). Calculate a Summary Do the following to calculate a total price for each order as a sum of Extended Price values: Add the Group Footer band to the detail report in the same way as the Group Header. Drop the Label control onto the added band and click its smart tag. In the invoked Label Tasks window, click the Summary field's ellipsis button. In the Summary Editor window: Set the Summary running property to the Report value to calculate the summary for the entire detail report. Set the Summary function property to Sum. Set the Argument Expression property to the field you want to sum up. Back in the Label Tasks window, use the Format String property to format the summary's value (for instance, set it to Total: {0:c2}). Sort Data Perform the following steps to sort data in the detail report: Select the Detail band in the detail report and switch to the Group and Sort Panel. Click Add a Sort, and in the invoked drop-down window, select the required data field. Use the Sort Order drop-down list to define the sort order. Customize the Report Appearance Do the following to customize the report and its elements' appearance: Click the gray area around the design surface to select the report, and in the Property Grid, specify the font settings. These settings are distributed to all report elements. You can adjust a control's font independently from its parent (for instance, make summary values bold). Change specific controls' (bound to date fields, price fields, etc.) text alignment using the Text Alignment property. Create a global visual style to apply it afterwards to multiple controls. Click the caption button in the Toolbar's Styles section. In the invoked Styles Editor, click the plus button and specify appearance properties for the newly created style. Apply a style to report elements by selecting them and clicking the created style in the Styles gallery. You can provide different appearances to alternating (odd and even) table rows in the detail report. Select the table and expand the Styles property in the Property Grid. Invoke the drop-down list for the EvenStyle property and select New. Specify the created style's appearance settings (for example, background color). Add Additional Information Do the following to provide additional information to your invoices, such as the report name and current date: Add the Page Header band to the master report to display the required information on each invoice page. Drop the Label control from the Toolbox onto the Page Header, double-click the control and type \"Invoice\". Specify the required appearance settings (font, foreground color, etc.). Add the Page Info control to the Page Header band to display system date in the report. Click the control's smart tag, and in the invoked actions list, set the Page Information property to Current Date and Time.

Settings To access the multi-column settings of a report's Detail band, use its smart tag or the Property Grid. Multi-Column Mode Enables you to select one of the following modes: None Disables the multi-column layout. Use Column Count Makes the report display a specific number of columns based on the Column Count value. When this property is set to 1, the report looks as though its multi-column layout is disabled. Use Column Width Makes the report columns have a specific width based on the Column Width value. With this setting, the report displays as many columns as it is possible according to the specified column width, column spacing and report page size. Column Spacing Specifies the distance between adjacent columns. This value is measured in report units. Multi-Column Layout Specifies the preferred direction for arranging report data within columns. First Across, then Down The report data is arranged horizontally and is wrapped to the next row on reaching the right page margin. When the report data is grouped, the multi-column layout is applied to each group individually. First Down, then Across The report data is arranged vertically and is wrapped to the next column on reaching the bottom page margin. When the report data is grouped, you can make each group start on a new column by setting the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band. How It Works The following image illustrates a report designer with a multi-column layout applied to the report: In multi-column mode, the report's design surface is limited to the area defined by the column width. This is the only area intended to contain report controls. The rest of this surface defines the space on a page remaining for printing columns and column spacing area. In the above image, the report data in the Detail band is contained within a Panel that provides borders around the enclosed content. You can also specify a custom background color for the Panel. To learn how to change this color dynamically (based on the report's underlying data), see Conditionally Change a Control's Appearance. When the report data is grouped (as in the above image), and the First Down, then Across multi-column layout is used, you can make each group start on a new column. To do this, set the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band or After the Band, Except for the Last Entry. When there is no data to display in the Group Footer, set the band height to zero."

    "keywords": "Reports with Cross-Band Content and Populated Empty Space This document describes how to create a report with the following layout options: Print part of the content across bands (the blue panel); Populate the empty space between the detail and footer information with blank rows. Initial Report In this tutorial, the report groups data by a data source field (the report's group field). The GroupFooter band is displayed at the bottom of the page (the Print At Bottom property is enabled). There is an empty space between the Detail band's data and the footer. Add Line Numbers Right-click the first cell in the Detail band's table and select Insert / Column to Left from the context menu. Select the new cell and specify the following property values: Summary: Group Expression: sumRecordNumber() Each row now includes a number. Populate the Empty Space Populate the empty space between the Detail band's data and footer. Click the Detail band's smart tag and enable the Fill Empty Space property. The empty space is now populated with numbered lines. Note Set the Text properties of the Detail band's controls to display static text within the added lines. Add Cross-Band Content to Report Groups Right-click the design surface. Select Insert Band / GroupHeader from the context menu. Tip Choose a PageHeader band instead to display the cross-band content on an entire page. Click the added band's smart tag and enable the Print Across Bands property. This displays the band content on the background of the GroupHeader1, Detail, and GroupFooter1 bands. The report's group field is in the GroupHeader1 band's Group Fields collection. The new band is above GroupHeader1 and does not participate in the report's group. Move the group field to the new band. Click GroupHeader1's smart tag, click the Group Fields property's ellipsis button and remove the group field from the invoked Group Field Collection Editor. Click the new band's smart tag, click the Group Fields property's ellipsis button and add the group field in Group Field Collection Editor. Add a Panel control to the GroupHeader. Specify the panel's Background Color and drop fields onto the panel. Adjust the panel's width and height. The height should match the page height, as the footer is printed at the bottom of the page (the GroupFooter's Print At Bottom property is enabled). Switch to Print Preview. The panel is printed on the background of the group content. Resize the content in other bands to print it side-by-side with the panel. See the final report in Print Preview."

Properties Overview Every report element (control or band), and a report itself, has a set of properties that specify its appearance. They are listed in the following table. Property Name Description Background Color Gets or sets a background color to a report element and its child controls. Border Color Gets or sets a border color to a report element and its child controls. Border Dash Style Gets or sets a border dash style to a report element and its child controls. Borders Gets or sets borders (top, right, bottom,left), which should be visible for a report element and its child controls. Border Width Gets or sets a border width to a report element and its child controls. Font Gets or sets the font options (its name, size, etc.) to a report element and its child controls. Foreground Color Gets or sets the foreground color to a report element and its child controls. Padding Gets or sets the indent values which are used to render the contents of a report element and its child controls. Text Alignment Gets or sets the text alignment to a report element and its child controls. Access Appearance Properties Use the Report Designer's Toolbar to access the appearance properties. More appearance properties are available in the Property Grid's Appearance tab. Property Value Inheritance By default, appearance properties for every control or a band are set to empty values, which means that their real values are obtained from a control's parent, or a parent of its parent and so on. Note The appearance properties may not be used by all descendants of the current report element for which they are defined. For example, the Page Break element ignores the Back Color property. To reset values of these properties, click the property marker in the Property Grid, and select Reset in the invoked menu. Then, the control's actual appearance will be determined by the appropriate properties settings of its parent. If a report element has a style assigned to it, the priority of the properties defined by this style is determined by the StylePriority property. Note that when a conditional formatting is involved, the appearance it defines is of greater priority than the properties described above."

    "title": "Introduction to Banded Reports | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Introduction to Banded Reports Banded reports provide a generalized report layout notion. When you preview a banded report, a report document is generated based on the report layout and data source. Report Bands A report layout consists of bands that contain report controls and define their location on document pages. A blank report contains the following bands: The Detail Band is printed for every record in a data source unless you filtered the data. Every report should have a detail band, and you cannot delete it. The Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands. These bands are repeated once on every document page. You can also add the following bands: Report Header and Report Footer The Report Header is the report's first band (margins are \"out-of-page\" zones). Use this band to display the report's name, company logo, date of creation, username, etc. The Report Footer is placed before the Page Footer and Bottom Margin on the report's last page. You can use the Report Footer band for report summaries or conclusions. Page Header and Page Footer These bands are at the top and bottom of every page in a report. They display information that should be printed on every page. Group Header and Group Footer These bands are above and below each group. The Group and Sort Panel create these bands automatically. Tip Only the detail and group bands can be used to display dynamic data source contents. Other bands display titles, summaries, and extra information. The following image illustrates a sample report layout and the Report Explorer that reflects the report's structure: Add a Detail Band to a Master-Detail Band Use the Detail Report band to create hierarchical master-detail reports. Detail report bands provide detailed information about each record in the master report's detail band (for example, orders shipped to each customer). You can create such reports when master-detail relationships are defined between data source tables: The Detail Report band is a separate report (subreport) with its own data source and different bands. A report can have any number of detail reports that can also be nested. The following image illustrates a master-detail report and the Report Explorer that reflects the report's structure: Vertical Bands You can replace the Detail band with the Vertical Header, Vertical Detail and Vertical Total bands to display record fields vertically and print data records horizontally - from left to right (and vise versa if the report's RTL mode is enabled). To add vertical bands to your report, right-click the report in the Report Designer and choose Insert Vertical Band in the invoked context menu. Note If your report's Detail band contains report controls, this band and all these controls are lost when you add a vertical band (the same behavior takes place in the opposite situation). The following vertical bands are available: Vertical Header Contains headers of the report's data fields. These headers are arranged vertically. Vertical Details This band is printed for every record in a data source unless you filtered the data. The records are displayed one after another in a horizontal direction. Vertical Total This band is placed at the rightmost position (leftmost when RTL is enabled). You can use the Vertical Total band for report summaries or conclusions. You can use the Report Wizard to create a report with vertical bands. Refer to the Vertical Reports topic for instructions on how to create a report with vertical bands. Create Band Copies You can create functional copies of a band, for example, to display different contents based on a specific condition. To do this, add sub-bands to bands. Tip See Lay out Dynamic Report Content for details on how to specify the location of bands' content on document pages. Manage Report Bands Expand or Collapse Bands in the Report Designer Click the arrow button on a band's title to collapse or expand that band. Click Collapse All on the Toolbar's View Tab to collapse all bands in a report. Click Expand All to expand all report bands. Right-click a band and select Collapse Other Bands from the context menu to collapse all bands except the clicked band. Hide Bands in the Report Document You can avoid printing band content in a document. To do this, select the band and set the band's Height property to zero or disable its Visible property in the Property Grid. Remove Bands Select a band on the report design surface and press DELETE. This removes the band and all its content. Add Bands To add a band, right-click a report's design surface, and in the invoked context menu, choose Insert Band. You can insert a detail report band if the report's data source has master-detail relations. Access the Bands Collection Click the Edit and Reorder Bands context link in a report's smart tag to access the report's bands collection. This command is also available in a band's context and smart tag menus. The invoked editor allows you to reorder bands and change their properties. Alternatively, use the Report Explorer to edit and reorder bands. Select a band and edit its properties in the Property Grid. Drag a band to change its order or move inside/outside of another band. The drop targets are highlighted when you drag a band over them. You can drag bands to the following targets: Dragged Band Drop Targets SubBand All bands except TopMargin and BottomMargin GroupHeader, GroupFooter XtraReport (root node), DetailReport DetailReport XtraReport (root node), DetailReport Apply Styles to Bands Select a band and switch to the Property Grid. Expand the Styles group and set the Style property to the style name. As an alternative, you can drag a style from the Report Explorer onto a band. This is applicable to all bands except DetailReport."

Print Preview provides the Editing Fields toolbar button if content editing is enabled for at least one control in the displayed report. Click this button to highlight all editable fields available in the document. Use the TAB and SHIFT+TAB keys to navigate between editable fields forward and back. Click an editable field to invoke an editor and specify a value. You can enable content editing for data-aware and unbound report controls.

You can use these options to set up content editing. Content Editing Limitations Changes made to a control's content in Print Preview does not effect the document's other parts (for example, summary results, grouping, sorting, bookmarks and other settings that were processed before the document was generated). A control's Can Grow setting is ignored for editable fields. The edited area cannot exceed the control's original dimensions. Multi-line values can only be entered when no mask is applied to an editable field. Values entered into editable fields are reset after the document is refreshed (for example, when you submit report parameter values or expand/collapse data in a drill-down report). It is not possible to edit content in bands if their DrillDownControl property is specified. The entered values are not preserved in the Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands when the report is exported as a single file to the following formats: TXT CSV HTML MHT RTF XLS XLSX image Text Editors Text editors are used to customize the Label, Table Cell and Character Comb report controls' content in Print Preview.

Specify the Character Comb's Edit Options | Editor Name property to use a text editor, as described in the Text Editors section above. Check Box Editor The check box editor is used to customize the Check Box report control's content in Print Preview. You can combine several check box editors into a radio group so that you can select only one option within a group at a time. For this, set the Check Box report controls' Group ID property to the same value. Image Editors Image editors are used to customize the XRPictureBox report control's content in Print Preview. Use the control's Edit Options | Editor Name property to assign one of the following image editors. Image Editor Allows you to load an image and specify the image's size options. Signature Editor Allows you to specify brush options and draw a signature. Image and Signature Editor (default) Allows you to load an image and draw a signature.

Run the Query Builder Use the Data Source Wizard or Report Wizard to bind your report to an SQL Database. Switch to the query customization page and click the Add button in the Queries row. Select Tables Drag the table that you want to add to a query from the list of available tables and drop the table onto the Query Builder surface. To find a table by name, switch to the table list, press CTRL+F, and enter the table name in the editor. Enable checkboxes for the table columns that you want to include in the query. If you want to include all the columns available in the table, enable * (All Columns). Right-click the table and select Rename or Delete to change the table's name or remove it. Join Tables You can join multiple tables within the same query. Do one of the following to add a table onto the Query Builder surface: Drag and drop a table from the table list onto the surface. Double-click a table in the table list. The table list on the left highlights all child and parent tables that are bound to the dropped table by a foreign key. Add required tables to the surface. The Inner Join relation with the previously added table is created automatically. Added tables display the green plus button for the columns that refer to other tables. You can click this icon to add a linked table to the query and create the Inner Join relation with this table. Right-click a relation to edit, delete, or reverse. The Edit Relation command invokes the Join Editor. It allows you to specify the join type (Inner, Left Outer, Right Outer, or Full Outer ), columns by which the tables should be joined, and a logical operator (Equal to, Is less than, or others) used to compare table columns. You can manually join tables if they are not bound by a foreign key at the database level. In this case, when you drag-and-drop a table onto the Query Builder surface, the Join Editor is automatically invoked, and this editor allows you to construct a custom join relation. Note When you join multiple tables within a single SQL query, you create a flattened table composed of data records selected based on the specified join relations. You can also create hierarchical data sources. In general, master-detail reports are generated faster than similar-looking reports created based on flattened data sources. If possible, use hierarchical data sources instead of flattened ones. Shape Data The Query Builder displays a list of the query's columns at the bottom-right corner. This list allows you to add new table columns to the query or shape selected table columns. The following options are available: Column - Specifies the selected column. Click the down-arrow button to display a drop-down column list and replace the column with another column. Click the ellipsis button to replace the column with an expression. Table - The table that contains the selected column. When you create an expression for a column, this option displays (All Tables). Alias - A custom column name. Output - Specifies whether to include the column in the query's resulting set. Sorting Type - Specifies whether to keep the initial data record order (Unsorted) or sort the records by the column (Ascending or Descending). Note When you bind a report to an XML file, the Query Builder does not support sorting by aggregate functions and the DISTINCT and SELECT ALL statements. Sort Order - Defines the sort order when data is sorted by multiple columns. For example, if column A has the sort order set to 1 and column B has it set to 2, data records are first sorted by column A and then by column B. This option is available if you enable the Sorting Type option. Group By - Specifies whether to group the query's resulting set by this column. Aggregate - Specifies whether to apply an aggregate function to column values. The following aggregate functions are supported: Count Max Min Avg Sum CountDistinct AvgDistinct SumDistinct When you want to use the Group By or Aggregate operations, you should apply them either to all columns or none of them. When you use these operations, only the result of aggregation or grouping is included in the result set. Filter Data Click the Filter button to invoke the Filter Editor. The editor has the following tabs: Filter Tab - Allows you to build criteria to filter data for the report. Filter criteria can reference query parameters, which you can also map to report parameters. Group Filter Tab - Allows you to specify filter conditions for grouped and aggregated data. This tab is disabled if the data is not grouped. You can also enable the Select only option to limit the number of resulting data records. If you enable the Sorting Type option for at least one column, you can specify how many data records should be skipped. Note Some data providers do not support the skip setting in the provider-specific SQL string. If you enable the Select only option for such data providers, data records are skipped but the SKIP statement is not included in the SQL query. The Select only distinct values option allows you to include only unique values into the resulting set. Edit Query Parameters Click Edit Parameters to invoke the Query Parameters dialog. This dialog allows you to add, edit, and remove query parameters. The created parameters are available on the Configure Query Parameters wizard page. The following properties are available for each query parameter: Name - The name by which you can reference the parameter. Type - The data type of the parameter's value. Expression - Specifies whether the parameter's value is static or generated dynamically. You can enable this option when you need to map the parameter's value to a report parameter's value. Value - The parameter's value. If the Expression option is enabled, this value is generated dynamically based on the parameter's expression. Refer to the following topic for more information: Specify Query Parameters. Preview Results Click the Preview Results button to open the Data Preview dialog. The dialog displays the first 1000 rows of the query result set. Manage Queries Right-click a data source in the Report Explorer or Field List and select Manage Queries in the context menu. This invokes the Manage Queries dialog that allows you to perform operations on queries and stored procedures. Add a New Query Click Add, specify a name for the new query, and select tables that you want to include in the query. Copy and Remove Queries Select a query and click the Copy or Remove icon. Modify Stored Procedures Select an existing stored procedure and choose a new one that you want to include in a query. Add a New Stored Procedure Expand the Add menu and select Stored Procedure. Rename a Query or Stored Procedure Double-click an item in the list of queries and stored procedures and use the editor to specify a new name for this item."

Use the Keep Together property to print the Group Header/Footer on the same page as the group's contents. Use the Repeat Every Page property to print the group band on each page. Use the Page Break property to start a new page before or after each group. When you need to display page numbers for individual groups, add the Page Info control to the Group Header or Footer and set its Running Band property to the Group Header's name. Accurate page numbering requires that different groups do not appear on the same page. For this reason, you need to set the Group Header's Page Break property to After Band, or place the Page Break control at the band's bottom."

    "title": "Calculated Fields Overview | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Calculated Fields Overview Calculated fields allow you to pre-process a report's input data, based on a certain expression. So, using calculated fields allows you to apply complex expressions to one or more data fields that are obtained from your report's underlying data source. Moreover, you can both group and sort your report data based on a calculated field's value. Calculated Fields Overview To create a calculated field, switch to the Field List, right-click any item inside the data source and select Add Calculated Field. Right-click the calculated field in the Field List and select Edit Expression. Alternatively, you can select the calculated field, and in the Property Grid, click the Expression property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Expression Editor, construct the required expression. You can use data fields, report parameters, predefined constants as well as various date-time, logical, math and string functions. See the next document section for more information about expression syntax. Note The Expression Editor displays only those data fields that are obtained from a data source specified by the calculated field's Data Source and Data Member property values. The report's Calculated Fields property provides access to the calculated field collection. You can click the Add Calculated Field button in the Toolbar's Home tab to invoke the Calculated Field Collection Editor. You can drag the calculated field from the Field List onto the required band like an ordinary data field. You can also group and sort your report data based on the calculated field values. Expression Syntax A data field is inserted into the expression's text using its name in [square brackets], and parameters are inserted using a question mark before their names. A calculated field's expression can evaluate the values of other calculated fields if you make sure to avoid circular references. Date-time constants must be wrapped in hashtags (#) (e.g., [OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#). To represent a null reference (one that does not refer to any object), use a question mark (e.g., [Region] != ?). To denote strings, use apostrophes ('), otherwise an error will occur. To embed an apostrophe into an expression's text, it should be preceded by another apostrophe (e.g., 'It''s sample text'). The type of a value returned by a calculated field is defined by its Field Type property. If a calculated field expression involves the use of different types, it is necessary to convert them to the same type (e.g., Max(ToDecimal([Quantity]),[UnitPrice])) Although a value that is returned by a calculated field is usually converted to a string (to be displayed in a text-aware report control), it can return a value of any kind. For example, if a database field contains an image, you can set a calculated field's expression to \"=...\", after which this calculated field can be bound to the Picture Box control. To construct a valid aggregate expression, use the following format, which consists of four parts. [<Collection>][<Condition>].<Aggregate>(<Expression>) <Collection> - Specifies a collection against which an aggregated value should be calculated. It can be the relationship name in a case of a master-detail relationship, or the name of a collection property exposed by the target class. For example, [CategoriesProducts][[CategoryId]>5].Count(). Empty brackets [] indicate the root collection. <Condition> - Specifies a condition defining which records should participate in calculating an aggregate function. To obtain an aggregated value against all records, delete this logical clause along with square brackets (for example, [].Count()). <Aggregate> - Specifies one of the available aggregate functions. <Expression> - Specifies an expression evaluating values to be used to perform calculation. For example, [][[CategoryID] > 5].Sum([UnitPrice]*[Quantity]). The Count function does not require field values to count the records, so leave the round brackets empty for this function. You can refer to the currently processed group using the Parent Relationship Traversal Operator ('^'). This allows you to calculate aggregates within groups using expressions like the following: [][[^.CategoryID] == [CategoryID]].Sum([UnitPrice]). For more information, see Expression Language.

For instance, operators are applied in the default order in the following expression: Accounts[Amount == 2 + 48 * 2] In the next expression, the addition operation is applied first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is applied last. Accounts[Amount == (2 + 48) * 2] Functions The expression language includes a set of functions that extend an expression's capabilities: Logical functions Date and time functions Math functions String functions Functions for expression bindings and calculated fields Functions for stored procedures Functions for the Summary Expression Editor You can also implement custom functions. See the following topic for a complete list of functions that are available in expressions: Functions in Expressions. Case Sensitivity Operators are case-insensitive. Case sensitivity of values can depend on the data source. For instance, SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case-insensitive. In this case, the following filter expression always evaluates to True: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with the @ escape character. In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as a field named Or, not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash (\\) as an escape character for characters in an expression, as shown below: \\[ \\\\ \\' Use an apostrophe (') as an escape character for string literals: 'A parameter''s value is:' + ?parameter1 Data Fields and Calculated Fields Enclose a data field or calculated field's name in square brackets ([ and ]): /* This expression is set for a control's Text property to bind the control to the UnitPrice data field. */ [UnitPrice] Ensure that the field with the specified name exists in the report's data source and data member. You can refer to data fields from a data member that is not specified as the report's data member (only the first record is returned): /* This expression is set for a control's Text property to bind the control to the UnitPrice data field from the Products data member (the report is not bound to Products). */ [Products].[UnitPrice] Report Parameters Use the following syntax to insert report parameters in an expression: Type a question mark before a parameter's name. ?parameter1 (Obsolete) Use the \"Parameters.\" prefix in front of a report parameter's name. [Parameters.parameter1] Enumerations Do one of the following to assign an enumeration value to a property: Specify an enumeration value by its underlying integer value. [Borders] = 1 The Expression Editor can help you specify a string value for built-in enumerations: Comments The expression language supports comments. For example: /* This is a comment within an expression. */ Comments start with the /* sequence and end at the matching */ sequence."

    "keywords": "Expressions Overview Use expressions to accomplish the following tasks: Retrieve data Format data values Create calculated fields Calculate summaries Specify conditions for report elements Specify conditions for data source queries How to Specify an Expression In the Report Designer, properties that support expressions have an ellipsis button in the value editor. Click this button to invoke the Expression Editor. As an alternative, you can use the Properties window to set expressions that specify property values. Click the f button to specify an expression in the invoked Expression Editor. In Expressions Advanced mode, the Report Designer allows you to specify expressions that are evaluated within specific events: The BeforePrint event where you can use data fields from all queries in the data source. The PrintOnPage event fetches the number of pages in the report and the current page. You can use these variables to specify conditions for report items. See the following topic for more information: Data Binding Modes. Expression Editor The Report Designer's Expression Editor has a graphical interface that allows you to create and edit expressions. Use one of the following ways to invoke the Expression Editor: Select a report, band, or control. The f button appears next to the selection. Click this button to invoke the Expression Editor. In the Properties window, if an expression can be set for a property, the f button appears near the value editor. Click this button to invoke the Expression Editor. The f button changes its color to blue to indicate that an expression is set for a property. The Editor lists all properties for which you can specify an expression. Click a property to specify an expression. An f icon appears next to a property where an expression is set. Additionally, an asterisk (*) appears if an expression is modified. The Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (which suggests functions and available data elements as you type). The Expression Editor displays all the errors it finds in the specified expression. The Editor lists a tree with language elements and items that you can use in an expression. FilterString Editor You can use the Report Designer's FilterString Editor to specify the FilterString property of a report, Cross Tab, or Chart Series. The FilterString Editor's visual interface allows you to use an unlimited number of conditions and combine them with logical operators to create filter criteria. You can also switch to Text mode and type a filter string. The FilterString Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (which suggests functions and available data elements as you type). Expression Syntax An expression can include field names, constants, operators, functions, data fields, and parameters. See the following topic for more information: Expression Language."

The following example demonstrates how to set a label's BackColor property to another label's BackColor property value: [ReportItems].[xrLabel2].[BackColor] Note [ReportItems] is a plain list that provides access to all report items at one level. You cannot use the ReportItems collection in a Calculated Field's expression. Specify Images for Picture Boxes When you specify an expression for the Picture Box's Image Source property, you can use image Ids from the report's ImageResources collection. IIf([MarchSales]>20, [Images.ArrowUp],[Images.ArrowDown]) Use Row/Column Indexes for Cross Tab Cells Use the following variables to change a Cross Tab cell's appearance settings: Arguments.GroupColumnIndex Returns the index of a cell's column within a group. iif([Arguments.GroupColumnIndex] % 2 == 1, Rgb(235, 241, 252), ?) /* Result: The specified color applies an odd-even color style to the Cross Tab's columns. */ Arguments.GroupRowIndex Returns the index of a cell's row within a group. iif([Arguments.GroupRowIndex] % 2 == 1, Rgb(235, 241, 252), ?) /* Result: The specified color applies an odd-even color style to cross tab rows. */ Use Variables for Event-Related Expressions DataSource.RowCount Returns the total amount of data rows in a data source. [DataSource.RowCount] != 0 /* Result: When this expression is applied to a control's Visible property, the control is hidden if the data source contains no data. */ DataSource.CurrentRowIndex Returns an index of the current data row in a data source. Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowIndex] % 2 = 0, 'red', 'green') /* Result: When this expression is used for a table row's BackColor property, odd rows are colored in red, even rows are colored in green. */ DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel Returns a zero-based level of the current row in a hierarchical report. Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel] == 0, Rgb(231,235,244), ?) /* Result: When this expression is used for the BackColor property of the Detail band that is printed in tree mode, the root level rows are highlighted. */ Note These variables are not valid when the report includes a table of contents. Specify Parent Relations Use the '^' parent relation operator to refer to a parent in expressions that are written in the context of a child. You can apply this operator successively to span multi-level parent relationships. You can use this operator to refer to the currently processed report group. This allows you to calculate aggregates within groups, as shown in the following expression: [][[^.CategoryID] == [CategoryID]].Sum([UnitPrice]) Test Collection Elements Use brackets to check if a collection contains an element that meets a condition. The following expression returns true if the Accounts collection contains at least one element that meets the [Amount] == 100 condition: [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] The following expression returns false if the Accounts collection is empty: [Accounts][] Refer to the following topic for an example on how to use this syntax: Calculate an Aggregate Function."

Drop a data field from this panel onto a report's surface to create a new report control bound to the corresponding field. Drop a data field onto an existing control to bind this control to the corresponding field. You can do one of the following to create a data-bound control of a specific type: Hold down the SHIFT key and drop a data field onto a report's surface. Right-click a corresponding data field and drop it onto a report's surface. This invokes a context menu that enables you to select which control to create. You can also drop an entire data table onto a report to create a Table control with its cells bound to the corresponding data table fields. To select multiple fields in the Field List, hold CTRL or SHIFT and click the fields. Drop these fields onto a report to create a new table. Use the Smart Tag Click a control's smart tag, expand the Expression drop-down list and select a data field. You can also click the Expression option's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor. This editor allows you to construct a complex binding expression with two or more data fields and various functions. See Expression Language for more information.

Layout Toolbar Use the Layout Toolbar commands to align report controls. Snapping Use the Snapping toolbar group or a report's Snapping Mode property to enable automatic report control snapping to a grid and/or snap lines. Snap Grid The design surface displays a visual grid that allows you to determine elements' size and location in a report. Use the Snap Grid Size and Snap Grid Step Count properties to customize the grid's settings. To hide the grid, disable the Grid Lines option in the toolbar's View tab or disable a report's Draw the Grid property. A report control is aligned to the nearest grid cell when moved with the mouse or ARROW keys. You can use the Align to Grid toolbar button or context menu item to align the selected controls to the grid cells. You can temporarily ignore snapping when you move and resize controls: hold down ALT if you move or resize controls using the mouse; hold down CTRL if you move or resize controls using the keyboard. Snap Lines The Report Designer displays snap lines when you move or resize report controls. These lines appear around the report controls and indicate the distance to other report elements (controls and bands). When you use the ARROW keys to move a report control or press SHIFT+ARROW to resize the control, it is aligned to the nearest report element in that direction based on snap lines. A report control's Snap Line Margin property and a band's or panel's Snap Line Padding property allows you to maintain a uniform distance between elements in a report. To avoid snapping controls, do the following: hold down ALT if you move or resize controls using the mouse; hold down CTRL if you move or resize controls using the keyboard."

    "keywords": "Add Barcodes to a Report Overview To insert a barcode into a report, drag the Barcode item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. After creating the barcode, select the barcode type (symbology) in the Barcode Tools toolbar tab's Symbology gallery. After specifying the symbology, you can customize the type-specific options of the barcode, which are listed in the Property Grid under the Symbology property. Main Options You can use the Binary Data property to supply the data that a barcode should encode. To specify the bar width (a barcode's resolution), use the following options: Automatically calculate the bar width according to a barcode's dimensions by enabling the Auto Module option; Provide a fixed bar width value using the Module property. The following are some additional barcode options: Use the barcode's Text property to provide accompanying text. The Show Text property allows you to show or hide this text. Use the Orientation property to rotate a barcode. Use the Padding property to specify the indent between bars and the barcode's inner boundaries. Frames for QR Codes For QR Codes (QR Code, GS1 QR Code, and EPC QR Code), you can use the Frame Options property to configure the frame around the barcode. The Corner and Rectangle frames are available for all types of QR Codes. Corner Frame The corner frame looks as follows: You can specify the following properties for corner frames: Frame Color Specifies the frame color. Frame Width Specifies the frame width in pixels. Padding Specifies the distance between the frame and QR code. Text Specifies the text that displayed in the frame. Text Alignment Specifies how the text is aligned with the frame line. Text Color Specifies the color of the text in the frame. Text Position Specifies how the text is positioned against the QR code. Rectangular Frame The rectangular frame looks as follows: You can specify the following properties for corner frames: Corner Radius Specifies rounded corners for the rectangular frame in pixels. Frame Color Specifies the frame color. Frame Width Specifies the frame width in pixels. Padding Specifies the distance between the frame and QR code. Text Specifies the text that displayed in the frame. Text Alignment Specifies how the text is aligned with the frame line. Text Color Specifies the color of the text in the frame. Text Position Specifies how the text is positioned against the QR code. Bind to Data You can bind the bar code's Text property to a data field obtained from a report's data source. Click the control's smart tag, expand the Expression drop-down list and select the data field. You can also click the Expression option's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor. This editor allows you to construct a complex binding expression with two or more data fields. Common Errors The following section explains how to work around the most frequently encountered errors related to the incorrect use of barcodes. The following error message is shown in place of the barcode if the control's dimensions are too small to fit the barcode with its specified resolution. To get rid of this error, enable the Auto Module property and/or increase the barcode's dimensions. The following error message appears when the data supplied to a barcode contains characters that are not supported by this barcode type. To avoid this error, supply data that applies to a particular barcode specification."

    "title": "Barcode Recognition Specifics | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Barcode Recognition Specifics This document describes the main specifics of barcode recognition and how to resolve the most frequently encountered issues when working with barcodes. Choose an Appropriate Barcode Type Selecting an appropriate barcode type (symbology) depends on your specific business requirements and the applied industrial standards. In general, consider using Barcode 2 of 5 Interleaved for encoding digits and Barcode 39 for encoding the full range of ASCII characters. Insert the Function Code Characters (FNC) or the Application Identifier into a Barcode Some encodings enable you to insert a special FNC1 character for separating application identifiers from the rest of the barcode. According to the GS1 specification, the FNC1 character is always inserted at the first position of the encoded data. Other identifiers can be inserted manually using the default \"#\" character. Although you can use any ASCII character as the FNC1 placeholder, it will not be a part of the encoded data as it does not have any direct ASCII representation. For the Code 128 symbology, you can also define FNC2-4 characters. For the list of the available application identifiers, refer to the official documentation at www.gs1.org. Specify the Barcode Resolution on Export to Third-Party Formats At present, only export to PDF preserves the original barcode in its vector form. Export to other formats will keep only the rasterized version of a barcode (with the default DPI set to 96). For XLSX and XLS export, the output resolution can be set up manually using the Rasterization Resolution property. Specify the DPI of the Device Used to Print the Bar Code The Target Device Dpi property allows you to specify the DPI of the device on which you wish to print your barcode. The XRBarCode control automatically adjusts bar density based on this property's value. Use the Target Device Dpi property to ensure that the bar code is scanned correctly on the target device. This is especially important if your printing device has a non-standard DPI setting. Common Issues This document section provides solutions to the most common issues that you may encounter when creating barcodes. The barcode is too \"dense\" The more information you wish to encode, the more bars should be drawn and the larger the barcode should become. The barcode's Module property specifies the width of the narrowest bar in a barcode. Although you can set this property to a very small value, the actual value is determined by the maximum resolution of your barcode printer device. Alternatively, consider using the Auto Module option to automatically calculate the optimal bar size based on the current barcode dimensions. Note When barcodes are \"dense\" and you are manually specifying the Module value, make sure that multiplying this value by the barcode printer resolution results in an integer number. Otherwise, rounding errors may occur on calculating the resulting bar width. For example, when the Module is set to 0.015 inches and the printer resolution is 300 DPI, their product equals 4.5, which may be rounded to 4 or 5 pixels for different bars and result in barcode recognition errors. In this case, the Module property should be set to 0.01333 (to make the bar width equal to 4 pixels) or to 0.01667 (to make the bar width equal to 5 pixels). The barcode is correctly displayed on the preview but it is not scanned Make sure that your scanner has been correctly set up to be able to recognize a specific kind of a barcode. If you are not certain about how to operate the scanner properly, please refer to its product manual. Avoid scanning barcodes from the monitor screen (e.g., using an application installed on your smartphone), because the screen DPI may not be sufficient to effectively recognize each particular bar. The barcode is correctly displayed on the preview but it is scanned incorrectly The cause for this problem may be an encoding issue specific to the \"binary\" input mode. By default, the UTF-16 encoding is used. However, your scanner device may use a different encoding model or even a codepage (i.e., a specific table that maps abstract values to real human-understandable characters). For additional information on this subject, please refer to the specification of your scanner device. The \"There are invalid characters in the text\" error occurs Different barcode symbologies define different ranges of allowed characters under different character sets. To avoid this error, please check the barcode specification."

To add a Character Comb to the report, drag the Character Comb item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. The number of cells displayed by the control in Print Preview depends on the Can Shrink and Auto Width settings. If both these properties are enabled, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters in the control's text. Otherwise, the number of cells corresponds to the specified cell size and the control size. See the Content Layout and Position section to learn more on using these properties. You can also adjust the character comb's size to match its characters using the Fit Bounds To Text toolbar button or context menu command: If the Word Wrap option is enabled, the command keeps control content displayed in multiple lines. It decreases the control's height and adjusts the width to fit this content. If the Word Wrap option is disabled, the command adjusts the control's height and width to completely display the control's content in a single line. As a result, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters. When exporting this control to third-party formats, consider the following When a report is exported to an XLS or XLSX file, the cells of the Character Comb correspond to the cells of a resulting Excel sheet. When a report is exported to a CSV (or TXT) file, the content of individual cells is separated (or spaced) by a specified Separator character. In most aspects, the Character Comb is similar to the Label control from which it inherits most of its properties and its basic behavior. For general information about binding these controls to data and display summary function results, see the Label topic. To learn about Character Comb specifics, see the following sections in this document. Main Options The following properties are specific to the Character Comb control: Cell Vertical Spacing and Cell Horizontal Spacing Specify the spacing between adjacent cells (measured in report units). These values do not depend on the specified border width of a control. The following image illustrates a Character Comb with Cell Vertical Spacing set to 15 and Cell Horizontal Spacing set to 5. Border Width Specifies the width of cell borders in pixels, as a floating point value. When the cell spacing is set to zero, the borders of adjacent cells are merged (i.e., the actual border width is not doubled). The following images illustrate how cell spacing affects the Border Width property behavior: Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing = 1 When the control's content is to be printed on multiple pages, a page break horizontally splits the cell border based on the cell spacing setting, as shown below. Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing > 0 Cell Size Mode Specifies whether or not the cell size should depend on the current font size of a control. The following cell size modes are supported: Custom The cell size is determined by the Cell Height and Cell Width property values and does not depend on the assigned font size. With this setting, the actual cell size is less than the specified Cell Height and CellWidth by the Border Width value. Auto Size The cell size depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height and Cell Width properties are ignored). With this setting, the actual cell size does not depend on the specified border width of a control. Auto Height Only the cell height depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height property is ignored), and the Cell Width value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell height does not depend on the specified border width of a control. The actual cell width is the difference between the specified Cell Width and Border Width values. Auto Width Only the cell width depends on the current font size of a control (the Сell Width property is ignored), and Cell Height value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell width does not depend on the specified border width of a control.

Double-click the label to invoke its in-place editor and enter the static text. Press CTRL+Enter to submit text changes and exit the label's in-place edit mode. Bind to Data Display Field Values You can bind the label's Text property to a data field obtained from a report's data source. Click the control's smart tag, expand the Expression drop-down list and select the data field. Click the Expression option's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor. You can use this editor to construct a complex binding expression from two or more data fields. You can also drag and drop a numeric or text field from the Field List to create a new label bound to this field. See the Bind Controls to Data topic for more information. The Process Duplicates Mode, Process Duplicates Target and Process Null Values options enable you to hide a control when a duplicated or null value appears in an assigned data source. You can also use the Format String property to specify output values' format. Display Summaries Specify a data range in the Summary Running property and select the summary function in the Summary Expression Editor to make the label display a summary function's result. Adjust the Label Size and Content Static Content You can change label size at design time to fit its static text. Right-click the label and select the Fit Bounds To Text toolbar button: If the Word Wrap option is enabled, the command displays control content on multiple lines. It reduces control height and adjusts its width to fit its content. If the Word Wrap option is disabled and the control's content is partially visible, the command adjusts the control size to display this content. The command's result also depends on the control's Text Alignment and Right To Left settings. Use the Fit Text To Bounds button to adjust the control's font size to fit its area. The Word Wrap option defines whether the text can occupy multiple lines or should be in a single line. These commands are not available in the following cases: A label's text is an empty string; A label's text is bound to data; A label's Angle property is specified. Data-Bound Labels The Can Grow and Can Shrink properties allow you to increase or decrease the control's height according to its content in Print Preview mode. Can Grow is enabled Can Grow is disabled Can Shrink is enabled CanShrink is disabled The Auto Width property specifies whether to adjust a data-bound label's width to its content. You can also use the opposite Text Fit Mode property to adjust a control's font size to fit its boundaries in Print Preview.

Text Fit Mode = None Text Fit Mode = Grow Only Text Fit Mode = Shrink Only Text Fit Mode = Shrink And Grow See the Arrange Dynamic Report Content topic for more information. Convert Labels to Table You can convert multiple labels to a table to simplify control alignment. Hold CTRL or SHIFT and click labels to select them. Right-click any of the selected labels and select Convert To Table from the context menu. A table with one row is added to the report instead of the selected labels. The Convert To Table option is not available if any of the selected labels overlap horizontally. The created table occupies horizontal space from the leftmost label's left edge to the rightmost label's right edge, and vertical space from the topmost label's top edge to the lowest label's bottom edge. The horizontal gap between labels is included in the left cell. The table cells copy all property values from the labels. Interactivity Check the Enabled option in the Edit Options category to allow users to edit a label's content in Print Preview mode. Click this label in a previewed document to invoke the editor. Use the label's Interactive Sorting option to allow users to click this label in Print Preview to sort report data.

Add the PDF Content Control to a Report Drop the PDF Content item from the Toolbox onto a band on the design surface. You can also copy a PDF document from an external application and paste it in your report, or drag a document and drop it onto the design surface. The dragged file's content is assigned to the control's Source property as binary data. Specify PDF Content Use one of the following methods: Specify binary PDF data This data is stored in the report file. The source of this data does not need to be available when the report is rendered. Specify a reference to a PDF document The reference to the document is stored in the report definition file. The referenced document should be available when the report is rendered. Specify PDF Data Expand the PDF Content control's smart tag, click the Source property's ellipsis button, and select a PDF file. When users save a report, the Source property value persists in the report file. You can also use report parameters to conditionally specify the Source property value or bind the property to a data source field. Refer to the following section for details: Use Expressions. Specify a Reference to a PDF Document Expand the PDF Content control's smart tag, click the Source URL property's ellipsis button, and select a PDF file. To specify a PDF document location on the Web, assign a document URL to the Source URL property. You can also use report parameters to conditionally specify the Source Url property value or bind the property to a data source field. Refer to the following section for details: Use Expressions. When users save a report, the URL or path specified in the Source URL property is included in the report file. The PDF document should be available at the specified location when a report is printed or rendered in Preview. The Source Url property value takes precedence over the Source property value. If you specify both properties, PDF Content includes the content specified by Source Url. If the file specified in the Source Url property cannot be loaded, the PDF data from the Source property is used. Use Expressions Expand the PDF Content control's smart tag and click the Expression property's ellipsis button below the Source or Source URL property. Use the invoked Expression Editor to create an expression that identifies the source of a PDF file. Embed PDF File Content into a Report Add the PDF Content control to a report, specify a PDF file location, and disable the control's Generate Own Pages property. Use Cases Create a report with PDF file content and headers / footers that are printed on PDF file pages. Print pictures, bar codes, page numbers, a report watermark, and other elements over the content of a PDF file. Create a report document with paper kind that differs from PDF pages paper kind. Refer to the following section for instructions: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Append PDF file content to report content and add sequential numbering to all report pages. For this, add PDF file content as a subreport to your report as described in the following section: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Then, add page numbers to both the subreport and main report. Design a pre-printed form and use PDF file as a watermark. If your PDF file contains one page, follow the steps below: Embed this page into a report's Detail band. Remove the report's margins to prevent duplication with PDF page margins. Adjust the page size to make it fit the entire Detail band. If your PDF file contains multiple pages, do the following: Create a subreport for each of the pages. Follow the instructions in this section: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Use the PDF Content control's Page Range property to specify the PDF file page that should be included to a subreport. Include each of these subreports to one report. Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size A PDF file and a report to which you embed PDF file content might have different paper kind. PDF file pages can also be generated with double margins: page margins and report margins. This section explains how to set the same paper kind for a report and its embedded PDF file and how to include only the PDF file's page margins to the report. The main idea is to create a subreport that includes PDF pages in embedded mode, and then, add this subreport to the main report that contains initial content. Create a blank report. Set the report's Paper Kind property to the paper kind of the main report to which you want to embed PDF content. Drop the PDF Content control from the Toolbox onto the created report's Detail band, specify a PDF file source, and disable the control's Generate Own Pages property. Remove the report's margins and adjust the PDF Content control size to make PDF content fit the entire Detail band. Add the report as a subreport to your main report. Use the Subreport control with the Generate Own Pages property enabled. The following image demonstrates the main report's Preview: Limitations PDF content is displayed as an image in Preview. Users cannot select text in PDF content. To allow users to select text, export the report to PDF.

To add the Picture Box control to a report, drag the Picture Box item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. Specify one of the following properties to set an image: Image Source Save the image to the report definition. Image Url Only save a path to the image. Assign an External Image Click the Image Source / Image URL property's ellipsis button to invoke the Open File dialog. The selected image or its URL is saved to the report definition .repx file.

Click the control's smart tag. In the invoked menu, expand the Expression drop-down list for the Image Source property and select a data field. You can bind the Image Url property to data in a similar way. In this instance, the URL that specifies the image location is obtained from the data source. Click the Expression option's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor. Use this editor to construct a binding expression that can include two or more data fields. Drag an image data field from the report's Field List and drop it onto a report band. Right-click a data field in the Field List and drop it onto a report band. Select the Picture Box item in the invoked context menu. See the Bind Report Controls to Data topic for more information about how to create data-aware controls. SVG Support Limitations The Picture Box control does not support the following SVG content: Gradient colors Text (you can convert text to curves as a workaround) Animations External .css styles Export (except for PDF) has the following limitations: SVG images are converted to metafiles because document viewers may not support SVG format. SVG images are exported as PNG in the Microsoft Azure environment. The Medium Trust permission level does not support SVG. Image Size Modes Use the Sizing property to specify an image's position in the Picture Box. This control supports the following image size modes: Normal The image is displayed at the top left corner with its original dimensions. The image is clipped if it does not fit the control's boundaries. Stretch Image The image is stretched or shrunk to fill the control's width and height. Auto Size The control's dimensions are adjusted to the image's size. Zoom Image The image is resized proportionally without clipping it to fit the control dimensions. Squeeze The image is centered and shown full-size if the control dimensions exceed the image size. Otherwise, the image is resized to fit the control's boundaries. Tile The original image is replicated within the control starting from the top left corner. The replicated image is clipped if it does not fit the control's boundaries. You can also use the Image Alignment property in the Normal, Squeeze and Zoom Image modes to specify the alignment in relation to the control's boundaries. Image Orientation The Use Image Metadata option allows you to specify whether to take into account the Exif metadata orientation of the image displayed in the Picture Box control. The Exif orientation property helps applications display the image in its intended orientation, regardless of how it was captured by the camera. This property contains a numerical value that specifies how much a saved image should be rotated to achieve a correct viewing angle. For example, if you capture a photo in portrait mode (holding the camera vertically), the camera may save the image in a landscape orientation. This can lead to the image appearing sideways or upside down when viewed on a computer or other devices. When you set Use Image Metadata to true, the Picture Box control reads the orientation property value and displays the image according to this value. The example below illustrates the use of the Use Image Metadata option. The Picture Box displays an image whose orientation in Exif metadata is 90 degrees clockwise. If you enable the Use Image Metadata option property, the image is rotated 90 degrees clockwise to orientate it correctly. Interactivity You can add a possibility to load/change an image and/or draw a signature in a picture box when it is displayed in Print Preview. To do this, enable the Edit Options | Enabled property. Click the picture box in a previewed document and an editor invokes. Tip You can draw borders for the picture box to make the editor visible in Print Preview, if an image is not specified. Refer to the Content Editing in Print Preview topic for details and to the Interactive E-Forms tutorial to see how the E-Form demo report uses this picture box mode."

The Cross Tab supports three field types (areas): Rows (the Row Fields collection) - displays field values as row headers. Columns (the Column Fields collection) - displays field values as column headers. Data (the Data Fields collection) - uses field values to calculate summaries at row and column intersections. Tip You can also use calculated fields if data source fields do not suit your requirements and you need to pre-process data before it is shown in the Cross Tab. Row and Column Fields You can drop two or more data fields onto the same area to create a hierarchy. The first field's values are displayed at the root level (the first column/row), the second field's values are grouped by the first field's values and displayed at the second hierarchy level (the second column/row), and so on. Specify Row Fields Specify Column Fields Cross Tab cells marked with a database icon become bound to the dropped fields. The corresponding rows/columns are printed in the document as many times as there are field values in the data source. The top left corner displays headers for row data fields. Additional rows/columns are added to the Cross Tab to display total values calculated against these fields. The last row/column displays grand total values calculated against all the rows/columns. Data Fields You can add two or more data fields and arrange them in two ways: in a column, one under the other (field headers are displayed as row headers); in a row, one after the other (field headers are displayed as column headers); When the data area contains only one field, the field header is not displayed. Note You cannot bind the top left corner, row/column totals, and row/column grand totals; You cannot bind Cross Tab cells to report parameters; You can only bind Cross Tab cells to fields from a data source and data member assigned to the Data Source and Data Member properties. Format Field Values Use a cell's Text Format String property to format output data. You can also use the Null Value Text property to specify the text shown when a data field's value is null or empty."

You can use the layout options to move rows and columns that display total values. If you want to hide specific totals, select any cell in the row/column and disable the Row Visible/Column Visible property. Change the Summary Type The Cross Tab summarizes values of data fields and displays the results \"as is\" at the intersection of the corresponding rows and columns. Use the Summary Type property to specify the summary function calculated against a data field. Use the Summary Display Type property to display results' contribution to other cell values, for example, as a percentage of grand total values. Sort Data The Cross Tab displays row and column field values in the ascending order. Use the Sort Order property to change the current sort order. Set this property to None to keep the same order as records in the Cross Tab's data source. You can also use the Sort By Summary Info property to arrange row/column field values based on grand totals values. Select a cell you want to sort and expand the Sort By Summary Info property in the Property Grid. Set the Field Name property to the name of an assigned data source's field. You can also define a field that is not currently displayed in the Cross Tab. Use the Summary Type property to specify which summary function to calculate. The summary type can differ from the summary type currently used in the Cross Tab. Use the Sort Order property to define the sort order. Group Data The Cross Tab displays unique values of column and row fields and does not group their values. Use the Group Interval property to combine original field values into categories (groups). For instance, you can group date-time values by year, month, quarter, day, hour. To group numeric values, set the Group Interval property to Numeric and use the Group Interval Numeric Range property to specify the interval length. For instance, set the range to 100 to group records by 100 orders. Use Parameters The Cross Tab uses and displays values of data fields from an assigned data source. To provide values outside the data source, use internal Cross Tab parameters. Each parameter is stored in the Parameters collection. You can access the Parameters property in the Cross Tab's smart tag or in the Properties window. Click this property's ellipsis button and add parameters in the invoked Collection Editor. You can bind a Cross Tab parameter to a report parameter or to any data field available in a report. You can then use the created parameters to filter the Cross Tab.

See the Report Explorer for a table structure example. You can double-click the cell to invoke its in-place editor and type the desired static text. You can adjust the font size of a cell's static text to fit into the cell's boundaries. Use the Fit Text to Bounds button in the toolbar's Text contextual tab, or right-click this cell and select Fit Text to Bounds in the context menu. Refer to Bind Table Cells to Data to learn about providing dynamic content to table cells. A table cell is like an Label control - it provides the same options for text formatting, alignment, appearance, interactivity, etc. You can also make a table cell act as a container for other report controls by dropping the required control from the toolbox on this cell. If a table cell includes only one control, you can right-click this control and use the Fit Bounds to Container command in the context menu. The same command is available in the toolbar's Layout tab. This command resizes the control so that it occupies all the available cell space (excluding borders). To transform a table into a set of Label controls, right-click a table or any of its cells and select Convert To Labels. Table cells containing other controls are converted to Panel controls. You can assign different visual styles for even and odd table rows to improve readability."

Applies a filter on the database level (for example, filters the values of the Products parameter based on the Category parameter value). Loads the filtered data to your report. You can also apply filter operations for the mentioned datasources on the application level. For this, disable the Use Server Side Filtering property (locataed in a parameter's Value Source category).

You can write scripts for a report or any of its elements (bands and controls), to be executed when the report is being previewed, printed or exported. In the Property Grid, expand the Scripts property for the required element. Every report element has an individual set of script events. After you click (New) for an event (e.g. the Before Print, which is the most used), the Scripts Tab is switched on, where you can manage and edit all the report's scripts. In this tab, for a selected event, a script template is auto-added, in the language specified via the Script Language property of the report. This tab contains all scripts written for all report elements, and allows you to quickly navigate through them by choosing the required report element in the corresponding drop-down list, and specifying one of its available events in another menu. The script editor supports intelligent code completion that makes it easier and faster for you to write scripts. Context-aware hints are displayed on typing a dot or pressing CTRL+spacebar. You can verify that your report's scripts are valid, by clicking Validate. The validation result is then displayed in the Scripts Errors panel.

    "title": "Understanding Style Concepts | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Understanding Style Concepts This document describes how you can provide a professional look to your reports by effectively adjusting the appearance of its elements. This document consists of the following sections. Appearance Properties Visual Styles Styles Priority Appearance Properties In the Report Designer, a report and each of its elements (bands and controls) has a complete set of appearance options (such as Background Color, Borders, Font, Foreground Color, Text Alignment, etc.). By default, these properties are not specified, meaning that their real values are obtained from a control's (or band's) parent, which is the report itself. So, the appearance specified for a report is distributed to all its child elements. Similarly, the appearance of a band is translated to the controls it contains. In turn, a control's appearance can be adjusted independently from its parent. Visual Styles In addition to the capability to specify appearance property values for every control and band, you can create comprehensive global styles (which are stored in the report's style sheet), and then assign them to individual report elements. Click the ellipsis button for the report's Style Sheet property to invoke the Styles Editor, which allows you to manage a report's style sheets, customize them, save them to a file and load from it. You can also invoke the Styles Editor by right-clicking the report and selecting Edit Style Sheet... in the context menu. To assign a particular style to a control, invoke the drop-down list for its Style property. Then, select one of the styles stored in a report's sheet collection or click the plus button to create a new style sheet. Note that if a style is assigned to a band, it is applied to all controls that the band contains. You can also use the Report Explorer to access the style collection. Commands of the context menu allow you to add, edit, clone or delete a style. Styles Priority A style defines the same appearance properties that are defined by a control's (or band's) appearance properties. When both styles and individual appearance settings are assigned to an element, you can control the priority of their options using an element's Style Priority property. By default, most of the Style Priority's options (Use Background Color, Use Border Color, etc.) are set to Yes. This means that if any style is assigned to a control, its properties will have a higher priority than the appearance properties of this element or its parent. You can assign a higher priority to an element's appearance property by disabling the corresponding Use* property. The following image demonstrates how the Style Priority property works. The same principles are applied to the odd-even styles feature, which allows you to alternate the appearance of consecutive data rows in your report. For details on this, refer to Use Odd and Even Styles. Note When conditional formatting is applied to an element, its appearance definition has the highest priority."

The first approach forces the default printer settings to be used when the report is printed, while the other one enables you to alter page settings independently. Using Settings of the Default Printer For the orientation, margins and paper size, you can specify a requirement that applies the corresponding printer settings instead of the report's. This may be useful when the report is printed in several places with different printers and printer settings. To do this, go to the Properties Panel, expand the Using Settings of the Default Printer property and enable required options. Specify the Report's Page Settings While designing the report, you can specify the page settings using the Properties Panel. You can select one the predefined paper sizes or specify a custom paper size. To create your own paper size, set the Paper Kind property to Custom, and then specify the Page Width and Page Height properties. You can also use the Paper Name property to select a custom paper that is used in the printer that the document is going to be printed on. To modify page margins, specify the Margins property. The margin values are expressed in the report's measurement units. In addition, you can set the page orientation using the Landscape property and specify whether the document is supposed to be printed on roll paper. You can also modify the paper size, orientation and margins in the Page Setup dialog, which can be invoked by clicking the Page Setup button on the Toolbar."

To select an appropriate alignment mode for report elements, use a report's Snapping Mode. Snap Grid When a report is being edited in the Report Designer, it is lined up by the snap grid. This helps to establish the distance between report elements and align them to each other. In the Snap to Grid mode, a report control that is being relocated using the mouse or the ARROW keys is automatically aligned with the nearest grid cell. When resizing the report control, its size is discretely changed by one grid cell. You can temporarily ignore snapping to the grid when moving and resizing controls. For this, hold down the CTRL key when using the mouse and the ALT key when using the keyboard. You can select whether the snap grid should be drawn over a report surface by setting the Draw the Grid option in the Properties Panel. You also can adjust the Snap Grid Size, which is measured in the measurement units set for your report. Snap Lines If the Snap Lines mode is selected, report elements are aligned using snap lines. These are special guide lines, which appear around the report control that is being moved or resized and indicate this control's bounds and the distance to other report elements (controls and bands). To disable snapping using snap lines for controls being relocated or resized, additionally hold down the ALT key. Snap Lines and Snap Grid The Snap to Grid and Snap Lines mode enables snapping to both the snap grid and snap lines. No Snapping To disable snapping in your report, set the Snapping Mode property to None.

Data-bound controls are indicated by a yellow database icon, both on the Design Surface and in the Report Explorer. To embed dynamic information to a report, if this information is contained in the report data source, you can use one of the following approaches. Using the Field List Using the Context Menu Using the Properties Panel After a control is bound to data, you can employ additional features that are listed in the Special Capabilities section of this document. Using the Field List The Report Designer allows you to create a data-aware element using the Field List. To do this, switch to the Field List panel, click the desired field item and drop it onto the report band. This automatically creates a control bound to the selected data field. Using the Context Menu Right click an existing report control, and in the invoked context menu, click the Edit... link. In the invoked Edit dialog, expand the Data Binding drop-down and select the required data field. To unbind a control's property, expand the Data Binding drop-down and click the Clear button. Using the Properties Panel Select a control (e.g., on the Design Surface) and switch to the Properties Panel. Expand the Data Bindings option and specify a data field for the required property (e.g., Text). To unbind a control's property, expand the corresponding drop-down and click the Clear button. Special Capabilities After a control is bound, you can apply formatting to its dynamic content (e.g., for it to be treated as currency, or date-time content). For details on this, refer to Formatting Data. It is possible to force a control to display a result of a summary function calculated across the data field to which it is bound. For more information, see Calculating Summaries. Another noteworthy option is to combine both static and dynamic content within the same control (e.g., to append some text prefix or postfix to a value obtained from a database), or even bind a control to multiple data fields at one time. This is detailed in Using Mail Merge. If you are required to perform pre-calculations over the data field to which a control is bound, you can do so by creating a calculated field, and binding the control to it. This is detailed at Calculated Fields. In turn, a calculated field may contain both dynamic and static parameters, which can be requested each time a report is being previewed. For more information, refer to Report Parameters."

This value can be either static or dynamically generated by an associated expression. In the Report Designer, query parameters are typically used in the following scenarios. Passed as criteria to the WHERE part of an SQL statement to perform data source level filtering. The query parameter's value is inserted into the resulting SQL query string in the position of the corresponding placeholder, which has the \"**@QueryParameterName**\" form. Passed as actual parameters to a stored procedure. See the Customize the Query topic to learn more. To create and configure query parameters to filter report data, do the following. When creating a new data-bound report using the Report Wizard or binding an existing one to an SQL data source, go to the query customization page. To open this page to customize an existing data source, right-click this data source in the Report Explorer and select Manage Queries in the context menu. Then, in the invoked Manage Queries dialog, click the ellipsis button for the required query. In the invoked Data Source Wizard, click the Run Query Builder... button.

Specifying a static value To specify a static value for a query parameter, select the parameter's value type, and then specify its actual value in the Value column according to the selected type. Specifying a dynamic value To use a dynamically generated value, do the following. First, activate the Expression check box for the required parameter. This allows you to use an expression to dynamically calculate the parameter's actual value. To map the query parameter to a new report parameter, click the plus button for the Value property, and in the invoked dialog, specify the required report parameter settings. Be sure to specify the report parameter type according to the type of the respective query parameter. Then, expand the drop-down list for the Value property and select the created report parameter.

The document consists of the following sections. Using Parameters Creating Parameters Passing Parameter Values Using Parameters Report parameters provide the capability to pass data of a certain type to a report and can be used in different ways listed below. Filtering You can use a report parameter to filter report data according to the current parameter value by specifying the report's Filter String. For more information, see the Filtering Data topic. Data Binding To show a parameter's value in a report, drag the parameter from the Field List panel and drop it onto the required band. This creates a Label bound to the parameter, as with an ordinary data field. For more information, see the Binding Report Controls to Data topic. Calculated Fields and Conditional Formatting Parameters can participate in constructing expressions for calculated fields and formatting rules, as well as standard data fields. The only difference is that a parameter is inserted into the expression's text using the \"Parameters.\" prefix before its name. Cascading Parameters You can filter parameter values by specifying the filtering expression that can also include other parameter values. To construct this filtering expression, set the parameter's Look-Up Settings Type property to StaticList or DynamicList and then specify its Filter String property. Multi-Value Parameters If a parameter is bound to a collection of standard values, it is possible to store more than one value in it. To do this, enable the parameter's MultiValue property. Multi-value parameters are useful when you need to filter report data against a list of values. The image below demonstrates a correct filtering expression that incorporates a multi-value parameter. The following image demonstrates an editor for a multi-value parameter in a Print Preview. Creating Parameters To create report parameters, follow the steps below. Create a new report and bind it to a data source. In the Field List panel, right-click the Parameters section and in the invoked menu, click Add Parameter. In the invoked Add New Parameter dialog, set the created parameter's Name and Description properties and make sure to set its Type to an appropriate value. To display this parameter in the Print Preview, enable the Show in the parameters panel option. To assign a list of values to this report parameter, enable the Supports the collection of standard values option. In the Dynamic values tab, you can specify a parameter's data source, data member, value member and display member. The value member defines a data field that provides values to the parameter. The display member defines a data field that provides display names for parameter values, i.e., how these values appear in the user interface available in a Print Preview. In the Static values tab, you can manually fill the list of parameter values. Each parameter value has an individual description specifying how this value appears in the Parameters Panel. Then, repeat the previous steps to create the second parameter, so that every time your report is previewed, you will be asked to specify two dates. Next, use parameters to filter your report's data. Select report, and in the Properties Panel, click the ellipsis button for the Filter String property. Then, in the invoked Filter String Editor, construct an expression where a data field is compared with the created parameters. To access parameters, click the icon on the right until it turns into a question mark. Passing Parameter Values To view the resulting report in the Report Designer, switch to the Print Preview tab. For a report containing at least one visible parameter, the dedicated Parameters Panel is automatically created in the Preview. This panel provides appropriate editors based on parameter types. To pass parameter values to the report, specify the required values and click Submit."

This documents consists of the following sections. Scripting Scripting Overview Maintaining Scripts Scripting Overview Scripts are program commands, placed within the event handlers of the required report elements. And when the corresponding event occurs (e.g., a mouse click), the script code runs. Scripting is made available to extend the standard functionality as far as may be required. You can write scripts for a report or any of its elements (bands and controls) to be executed when the report is being previewed, printed or exported. The Report Designer allows you to write scripts using the Script Editor. This editor supports C# and Visual Basic .NET scripting languages. This means that the scripting language is independent from the language used to create the report. The language is specified by the Script Language property of a report. The selected scripting language must be the same for all scripts used in a report. Maintaining Scripts Each report element has its own set of events, which are individual for each element type. To handle an event of a report element, do one of the following. Select the required report element (e.g., on the Design Surface). In the Properties Panel, expand the Scripts property and click the plus button for the event. Click the Scripts button () in the Toolbar to display the Script Editor. Choose the required report element in the dedicated drop-down list at the left top of the Script Editor. Then, select one of the available events in another list at the right top. After the event is specified, a code template is automatically generated in the current scripting language and added in the Script Editor. To check for errors in the report's script, click the Validate button. The validation result is displayed in the errors panel at the bottom of the Script Editor. Double-click the error item in the panel's list to go to the corresponding line of code. If all scripts are valid, the errors panel is empty."

    "keywords": "Calculating Summaries With the Report Designer, you can force a data-bound control to calculate one of the standard summary functions (Average, Sum, Count, Max, Min, etc.). To calculate summaries (totals) within a report, follow the instructions below. Create a new report and bind it to a data source. This tutorial starts with the following report layout. To display a summary at the bottom of the report, add the Report Footer band. To do this, right-click the report's area and in the invoked context menu, select Insert Band, and then Report Footer. Switch to the Field List panel, select the field for which a summary will be calculated and drop it onto the created Report Footer band. Right-click the newly created Label and select Edit... in the context menu. In the invoked dialog, click the ellipsis button for the Summary property. In the invoked Summary Editor, specify the summary options. In the Summary function drop-down, select Sum. Note that in addition to a simple summary, you can choose among numerous built-in functions (such as Count and Average). The Summary Running option is set to Report to ensure that all values from the specified data field are taken into account. You can also define a summary function's Format string. Note that value formatting is applied to a summary independent of general formatting and has a greater priority. The Ignore NULL values option would not affect the result in this example, since NULL values are treated like zeros by default. This option makes sense for functions like Count or Average, because the number of elements counted will depend on this option. To save the settings and close the dialog, click OK. Switch your report to the Print Preview tab to view the result."

To accomplish this, construct a filtering expression using single or multiple data fields. This document describes two approaches to filtering data in the Report Designer. Filter Data at the Report Level Filter Data at the Data Source Level Filter Data at the Report Level To filter a report's data, do the following. Right-click the report and select Edit... in the context menu. In the invoked dialog, click the ellipsis button for the Filter String property. Then, in the invoked Filter String Editor, specify the filtering expression. When creating a filter criteria, you can create and edit logical expressions, and also join the expression groups with And, Or, NotAnd, and NotOr operators. In every filter condition, the left part contains either the data field name, or the name of the calculated field, which exists in this data source at the same level. The right part of the condition contains either a certain numerical or string value, or the name of the report parameter. To access parameters, click the icon on the right, until it turns into a question mark. To quit the dialog and save the changes, click OK. Filter Data at the Data Source Level To filter data before it has been supplied to a report, you can modify a query of an SqlDataSource assigned to the report's Data Source property. To do this, perform the following steps. Invoke the Manage Queries dialog using one of the following ways. Switch to the Report Explorer and right-click the data source item under the Components node. In the invoked context menu, select the Manage Queries... command. Select a data source, and in the Properties Panel, click the ellipsis button for the Queries property. In the invoked dialog, click the ellipsis button corresponding to the required query. Next, in the invoked Data Source Wizard, click the Run Query Builder... button. In the Query Builder, click the Filter... button. In the invoked Filter Editor, construct a filtering expression that will be used to filter resulting data at the data source level. Note that it is possible to embed query parameters into the expression."

In the invoked Format String Editor, select one of the predefined standard formats or specify a custom one. To quit the dialog and apply the changes, click OK. In a similar way, you can apply formatting to a control's Bookmark, Navigation URL and Tag properties using the Properties Panel. Note that the set of bindable properties depends on the control type. When a summary function is applied to a control's dynamic content, value formatting is specified separately as described in the Calculating Summaries document. Independently from general and summary value formatting, you can specify a native XSLX format string, which is preserved when the report is exported to XLSX.

Run the Query Builder Select Tables Join Tables Edit Parameters Filter Data Shape Data Enable Custom SQL Editing Preview Results Run the Query Builder You can invoke the Query Builder from the query customization page of the Report Wizard when creating a new data-bound report or when binding an existing one to a database. To do this, select the Query item and click the Run Query Builder button. You can also use the Query Builder to add queries to an existing SQL data source, as well as to edit existing queries. To do this, right-click the data source in the Report Explorer and select Manage Queries in the context menu. In the invoked Manage Queries dialog, click Add to add a new query. To edit an existing query, click the ellipsis button. Finally, click the Run Query Builder button in the invoked Data Source Wizard. Select Tables To add a specific data table or view to a query, drag the corresponding item from the list of available tables and drop it onto the list of data tables to be used. Enable check boxes for the table fields that you want to include in the query result set. Each table provides the context menu, which allows you to rename the table or remove it from the query. To search for a specific table or view, click the list of available tables on the left and start typing the search name. Join Tables You can join multiple tables within the same query. The Query Builder automatically highlights tables related to any of the previously added tables. Drag-and-drop a subordinate table in the same way as a principal table to include it in a query and automatically create an inner join relation based on a key column. Another way to join tables is to click the button in a row corresponding to a key column. To customize the relationship, click the corresponding ellipsis button. Use the Join Editor to select the join type (Left Outer or Inner), applied logical operator (Equals to, Is less than, etc.) and column key fields. A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join along with all values in the \"left\" table that do not match to the \"right\" table, including rows with NULL (empty) values in the key field. If tables do not have a relationship at the database level, you can manually join tables. In this case, when you drag-and-drop the required table onto the list of tables to be used, the Join Editor is automatically invoked allowing you to construct a custom join relationship. After executing the query, it will return a \"flat\" table composed of data records selected based on the specified join options. Note Although joining different tables within a single query may be required in some scenarios, creating hierarchical data sources generally results in better performance (in general, master-detail reports are generated faster than similar-looking reports created by grouping \"flat\" data sources). Edit Parameters Click the Edit Parameters button to invoke the Query Parameters dialog, which allows you to add and remove query parameters as well as specify parameter settings. For each query parameter, the following properties are available. Name - specifies the name used to refer a parameter. Type - specifies the data type of the parameter's value. Expression - determines whether the actual parameter value is static or generated dynamically. Value - specifies the actual value of a query parameter. If the Expression option is enabled, the actual parameter value is produced dynamically by calculating an associated expression, which is particularly useful when you need to map the query parameter value to the value of a report parameter. The created parameters will be then available on the Configure Query Parameters wizard page. For general information on query parameters, see Query Parameters. Filter Data To specify filter criteria, click the Filter... button in the Query Builder. This invokes the Filter Editor, which provides the following capabilities. Filter Tab The editor contains the Filter tab allowing you to specify filter conditions for resulting data. Filter criteria can be assigned query parameters or bound to report parameters. Group Filter Tab The Group Filter tab allows you to specify filter conditions for grouped and aggregated data. If data is not grouped, the second tab is disabled. Other Options Using this editor, you can limit the number of resulting data rows. If data is sorted, you can specify how many rows to skip before retrieving the specified number of rows. Note Depending on the selected data provider, it can be impossible to take into account the skip setting in the provider-specific SQL string. Another option enables you to include only distinct values into the resulting set. Shape Data The Query Builder displays the column list under the data source editor, which provides various shaping options. The following options are available. Column Specifies the selected column. You can choose a required column in the drop-down list or create a column expression by clicking the ellipsis button for the corresponding column. Table Specifies the table containing the selected column. This option indicates (All Tables) if an expression is specified for the corresponding column. Alias Specifies a custom column name (alias). This option is available only for columns that are included in a query. Output Specifies whether or not the column is included into the query’s resulting set. Sorting Type Specifies whether to preserve the original order of data records within the column, or sort them (in ascending or descending order). Note When binding to XML files, the Query Builder does not support sorting by aggregate functions, DISTINCT and SELECT ALL statements, and custom SQL. Sort Order This option becomes available after applying sorting to the data column records. It defines the priority in which sorting is applied to multiple columns (the less this number is, the higher the priority). For example, if column A has the sort order set to 1 and column B has it set to 2, the query will be first sorted by column A and then by the column B. Changing this setting for one column automatically updates the sort order of other columns to avoid a conflict of priorities. Group By Specifies whether or not the query’s result set should be grouped by this column. Aggregate Specifies whether or not the column's data records should be aggregated. The following aggregate functions are supported. Count Max Min Avg Sum Count Distinct Avg Distinct Sum Distinct Applying any of these functions to a column will discard individual data records from the query result set, which will only include the aggregate function result. Note You should apply aggregation/grouping to either all columns or to none of them. Enable Custom SQL Editing If custom SQL editing is enabled by your software provider, the Query Builder contains the Allow Edit SQL check box. Selecting this option disables the visual features of the Query Builder and allows users to specify the custom SQL string manually. Preview Results You can preview the result of the query execution in the form of a tabular data sample by clicking the Preview Results button. This opens the Data Preview window displaying the query result set limited by the first 1000 data records."

Scripting Overview Maintaining Scripts Scripting Overview The Script Editor provides you with the capability to write and execute scripts at runtime when a report is generated. Scripting is made available to extend the standard functionality as far as may be required. The Script Editor supports C# and Visual Basic .NET scripting languages. This means that the scripting language is independent from the language used to create the report. You can specify the language using the Script Language property. The selected scripting language should be the same for all scripts used in a report. Maintaining Scripts Each report element has its own set of events, which are individual for each element type. To handle an event of a report element, do one of the following. Select the required report element (e.g., on the Design Surface). In the Properties Panel, expand the Scripts property and click the plus button for the event. Click the Scripts button () in the Toolbar to display the Script Editor. Choose the required report element in the dedicated drop-down list at the left top of the Script Editor. Then, select one of the available events in another list at the right top. After the event is specified, a code template is automatically generated in the current scripting language and added in the Script Editor. To check for errors in the report's script, click the Validate button. The validation result is displayed in the errors panel at the bottom of the Script Editor. Double-click the error item in the panel's list to go to the corresponding line of code. If all scripts are valid, the errors panel is empty."

    "keywords": "Report Bands A Report Band is a specific area on a report page, used to define how to render report controls that belong to it, their rendering order and how many times they are rendered. In the Report Designer, every report consists of a number of bands, each of a different type. This document consists of the following sections. Available Bands Band Positions Editing Bands Available Bands The following table lists all available band types. Band Description Top Margin Band Located on the top margin of every page, above the Page Header and Report Header. This band is intended for displaying page numbers or certain supplementary information (e.g., current system time or the user name). Report Header Band Located at the beginning of a report. This band is intended to display some introductory information, e.g., the report's name, company logo, date of creation and user name, etc. Page Header Band Located at the top of every page, below the Top Margin and Report Header. This band is the best place for information that should be printed on every page. For example, use it to display the header of a table which is continued from the previous page. Group Header Band Located at the beginning of every group or at the top of the page in case it is split across pages. This band specifies grouping criteria and is used to display information at the beginning of a group of records. To learn more, refer to Grouping Data. Detail Band Located in the central part of a report between all other bands. This band cannot be deleted since the present report structure includes the Detail band in its core. This band displays a single record at a time from the bound data source, or simply holds unbound controls if there is no data source assigned to a report. For more information on data binding, refer to Providing Data. Detail Report Band Located below the Detail band and used to incorporate one report into another in master-detail reports. It is quite different from the Detail band, since it holds the whole detail report in a master-detail report layout, and therefore can contain other types of bands within it. To learn more about detail reports, refer to Master-Detail Report (Detail Report Bands). Group Footer Band Located at the end of every group or at the bottom of the page if its group is split across pages. This band is primarily intended to show summary information for a group. To learn more, refer to Grouping Data. Report Footer Band Located at the end of the report, before the Page Footer and Bottom Margin on the report's last page. This band is intended to display some final information, e.g., report totals. Page Footer Band Located at the bottom of every page, below the Report Footer and above the Bottom Margin. This band is intended to display page numbers or a table footer, which is continued on the following page. Bottom Margin Band Located on the bottom margin of every page, below the Page Footer. This band is intended for displaying page numbers or certain supplementary information (e.g., current system time or the user name). Sub-Band This band provides a functional copy of the source band below which it is located. A sub-band's behavior, as well as its position within the report band hierarchy, is dictated by the source band type. Any number of sub-bands can be added to the report band of any type except for the Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands and the sub-band itself. Using sub-bands, it is possible to create multiple versions of a band within a single report and choose an appropriate version later based on a specific condition. Band Positions The following image illustrates the relative positions of different band types, and how many times they are rendered in a report. The Page Header, Page Footer, Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands are rendered in the report preview on every page. The Report Header and Report Footer bands are rendered in the report preview only once. The Group Header and Group Footer bands are rendered for every group of records in a report. The number of times the Detail band is rendered in a report depends upon the number of records returned from the bound data source - one band per record. Editing Bands The following image shows the default report layout. It is divided into three basic bands (Top Margin, Detail and Bottom Margin bands) that provide space for placing different report controls on them. To add a new band of a particular type, use the context menu of the report or bands. Right-click a report on the design surface or in the Report Explorer, and select a band to be inserted in the report. For more information on adding and removing bands in the Report Designer, refer to the Create and Delete Report Elements document. To learn how to change the band layout, see Adjust the Layout of Report Elements."

    "title": "Report Controls | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Report Controls In general, report controls allow you to present information of different kinds (e.g., simple or formatted text, pictures, tables, etc.) in your static and dynamic reports, and to adjust your report's layout (by organizing controls within panels, and inserting page breaks at the required positions). The following table lists the available controls (in the same order as in the Toolbox). Icon Description The most basic Label control is intended to display static or dynamic text or both in your report. In addition, it can be used to calculate standard summary functions across a data field. The Check Box control is intended to display True/False or Checked/Unchecked/Indeterminate states in a report by displaying (or not) a check mark, which can be accompanied by a text description. The Rich Text control allows you to display formatted text in your report. It can display static or dynamic text or both. You can also load content to the Rich Text from an external TXT or RTF file (which can contain images). The Picture Box control is intended to display images of numerous formats in a report. An image can be loaded from an external file, from a bound data source, or from a web location using the specified URL. The Panel control is a container that frames separate report controls to allow them to be easily moved, copied and pasted, and visually unite them in the report's preview (with borders or a uniform color background). The Table control is designed to arrange information in a tabular layout. It may contain any number of rows comprised of individual cells. Both rows and cells can be selected and customized individually. In most aspects, a cell is similar to a Label, but can also contain other controls (e.g., Picture Box or Rich Text). The Character Comb control displays text so that each character is printed in an individual cell. The Line control draws a line of a specified direction, style, width and color. It can be used for both decoration and visual separation of report sections. The Line cannot cross report bands, as opposed to the Cross-band Line control. The Shape control allows you to embed simple graphic objects into your report. You can choose one of the multiple predefined shapes (e.g., rectangles, ellipses, arrows, polygons, crosses and brackets of various kinds). The Barcode control transforms its content into a barcode of the specified type. Multiple standard barcode types are supported. The Zip Code control renders a numeric postal code that is used to identify the mail address in some countries. This control is not related to the Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code used by the United States Postal Service. The Chart is a sophisticated control used to embed graphs into your report. It graphically represents a series of points using numerous 2D or 3D chart types. A Chart can be populated with points both manually (by specifying arguments and values for each point) and dynamically (by connecting it to the report's data source or binding it to a separate one). See Chart with Static Series and Chart with Dynamic Series for more information. The Gauge control provides you with the capability to embed graphic gauges into your report. The Sparkline control displays a compact chart that is commonly used to reflect the flow of data for every row in a report. The Pivot Grid control represents dynamic data (obtained from an underlying data source) in a cross-tabulated form to create cross-tab reports, similar to Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel®. Column headers display unique values from one data field, and row headers - from another field. Each cell displays a summary for the corresponding row and column values. By specifying different data fields, you can see different totals. This allows you to get a compact layout for a complex data analysis. The Subreport control allows you to include other reports in your current report. To learn more, see Master-Detail Report (Subreports). The Table Of Contents control generates a table of contents based on bookmarks specified for report elements. The Page Info control is intended to add page numbers and system information to a report (the current date and time or the current user name) into your report. As with many other controls, you can format this control's content. The Page Break control's sole purpose is to insert a page delimiter at any point within a report. The Cross-band Line control allows you to draw a line through several report bands. This can be useful if you need to visually emphasize a section consisting of multiple band areas. In other aspects, it is similar to a regular Line. The Cross-band Box control allows you to draw a rectangle through several report bands. This can be useful if you need to visually encompass a section consisting of multiple band areas. To learn how to create report controls and change their layout, refer to Create and Delete Report Elements and Adjust the Layout of Report Elements."

This is possible when data for all series (their names, along with point arguments and values) is stored in the same data table. Note that in this scenario, the view type and certain other settings will be the same for all series. To adjust a Chart with automatically created series, do the following. Create a new empty report. Drop the Chart control from the Toolbox onto the report's Detail band. After you drop the Chart, the Chart Designer is automatically invoked. At this step, click Cancel to close the Designer, it will be used later. To bind the Chart to a data source, right-click it and select Edit... in the context menu. Then, in the invoked dialog, expand the Data Source drop-down and click Add New. The invoked Data Source Wizard will guide you through the process of assigning a data source to the Chart. For detailed instructions on the Wizard's steps, refer to Binding a Report to Data, as this process is similar. After the data source is created, it is assigned to the Chart's Data Source property. Its Data Member property defines from which table or view of your data source the Chart obtains its data. Note Since you have placed a Chart in the Detail band, the report's Data Source property should not be set. Otherwise, the Chart will be repeated at the preview as many times as there are records in the data source. Once again, right-click the Chart and select Run Designer... in the context menu. When the chart is added to the report, a new static series is created automatically. In the invoked Chart Designer, remove this series by clicking the corresponding button. Then, go to the Data tab at the right of the Designer's window. Choose an existing data source in the dedicated drop-down list and drag-and-drop the required data fields to the corresponding cells. The Series cell specifies the data field, which should provide data for the series names, so that a new series is created for each record in that data field. Use the Argument and Value cells to define from where data for point arguments and values is obtained. Switch to the Properties tab and expand the Series Template option. As you can see, the Argument Data Member and Value Data Members properties have been automatically assigned to the corresponding data fields. Make sure that the Argument Scale Type and Value Scale Type properties are set to appropriate values. At this point, the chart's data options are completely defined, so in this step, certain additional customization capabilities are described. Adjust the Series Name Template By default, the name for every auto-created series is obtained directly from an appropriate data field in the bound data source. However, you can add some text to the beginning or to the end of every series name using the Chart's Series Name Template property. For instance, set the Begin Text property to \"GSP in \". Customize Series Labels To avoid the overlapping of series labels, expand the Chart's Series Template property and set the Labels Visibility property to No. If required, it is possible to customize many other properties for the Chart, which are not described here.

Go to the Properties tab to see that the Argument Data Member and Value Data Members settings are automatically assigned to the corresponding fields. In addition, you can filter the series data. To do this, click the ellipsis button for the Data Filters property, and in the invoked dialog, create and adjust the filtering criteria. To save the changes and quit the dialog, click Close. Create one more series with the same settings, but select the Point view type. To do this, locate the Series element in the chart elements tree and click the plus button. In the invoked list of series types, select the required type. Finally, to improve your Chart's appearance, you can make the following adjustments. Remove the Chart's legend as it shows the same data for both series. To do this, select the Legend in the chart elements tree, and in the Options tab, set the Visibility property to No. The point labels for Series 1 are unnecessary, so select the Label node under this series and disable the Labels Visibility check box. Rotate the X-axis labels for better readability. To do this, select the Axis X item, and in the Properties tab, adjust settings for labels using the Label property. For instance, set the Angle property to 20 and the Antialiasing property to Yes. If required, it is possible to customize many other properties for the Chart, which are not described here.

Provide a Report Data Source with a Master-Detail Relation Design a Master-Detail Report View the Result Provide a Report Data Source with a Master-Detail Relation This section of the tutorial describes how to provide an SQL data source with a master-detail relation. If you are using an Entity Framework data source that contains data members with master-detail relations between them, the existing relations will be used automatically. In this case, you can skip this section of the tutorial and proceed to the next section: Design a Master-Detail Report. To add a master-detail relation to an SQL data source, do the following. Add a detail table to the report data source. To do this, right-click the data source in the Report Explorer, and select Manage Queries... in the invoked context menu. In the invoked Manage Queries dialog, click Add. Then, in the invoked Data Source Wizard, click Run Query Builder.... Add the detail table to the query and click OK. Click Finish to exit the Data Source Wizard. Then, click OK to exit the Manage Queries dialog. Next, specify the relation between the data source tables. To do this, right-click the data source in the Report Explorer, and select Manage Relations... in the invoked context menu. In the invoked Master-Detail Relation Editor, click the plus button next to the master query to add a new relation. Specify a relation condition as shown in the following image and click OK to exit the dialog. The Field List will be updated to reflect the added relation. Design a Master-Detail Report To create the layout of a master-detail report, do the following. Allocate parts of a master report on the report's Detail band. ­ For the master report to be generated properly, the report's Data Member should be set to the master query. If you added the master query first, this property is set to the required value automatically. Otherwise, you should manually specify the data member (for instance, in the Properties Panel). To add a detail report band, right-click anywhere on the report's surface, and in the invoked context menu, select Insert Detail Report. When the report's data source contains a data relationship, it is displayed in the context menu. Then, drop the required data fields from the Field List onto the Detail Report band. Note that you should drop items from the relation node (in this example it is the CategoriesProducts section) for the detail report to be generated correctly. View the Result The master-detail report is now ready. Switch to the Print Preview tab and view the result."

Italic Formats the watermark’s text as italic. Foreground Color The foreground color of the watermark’s text. Text The watermark’s text. Text Transparency The transparency of the watermark’s text. Text Direction The incline of the watermark’s text. Text Position Specifies whether a watermark should be printed behind or in front of page content. Page Range The range of pages which contain a watermark. The added watermark is automatically displayed in the report in Preview mode. Specify Picture Watermark Settings Watermark Id The unique identifier of a watermark used to specify the watermark in the WatermarkId property (See the Manage Watermark Collection section for details). Image Source Specifies the image that you wish to use as a watermark. Image Position Specifies whether a watermark should be printed behind or in front of page content. Image Transparency The transparency of the watermark’s image. The Transparency property is unavailable when you specify an SVG image. Image View Mode The mode in which a picture watermark is displayed. Image Tiling Specifies whether a picture watermark should be tiled. Image Alignment Specifies the horizontal or vertical alignment of the watermark. Page Range The range of pages which contain a watermark. The added watermark is automatically displayed in the report in Preview mode. Supply a Preprinted Form You can use a picture watermark as a template, to display an image of the preprinted form on the report's body at design time. To display a watermark at design time, expand the Design category and enable the Draw the Watermark property. The following image illustrates a report with a watermark shown at design time that contains a template of a preprinted form. Place report controls on the report's body according to the layout of the preprinted form. Supported Image Formats A picture watermark supports the following formats: BMP JPG / JPEG / JPE / JFIF GIF TIF / TIFF PNG ICO DIB RLE EMF / WMF SVG Combine Text and a Picture in One Watermark You can display both text and a picture in one Watermark. Use the Text Position and Image Position options of the watermark to specify whether the text and picture should be displayed behind or in front of page content. For example, create a watermark and specify its text and picture settings. Set position of the text to InFront and position of the picture to Behind: As a result, the image is displayed behind the table, while the text is in front of the content: Display Watermarks According to the Specified Condition Bind the report's Watermark Id options to an expression to apply watermarks stored in the collection to specific report pages. This option allows you to apply a specific watermark to a page based on the Watermark Id or expression binding. For example, the following expression adds the created “First page watermark”, “Even page watermark”, and “Odd page watermark” watermarks to the first, odd, and even pages of a report: Iif([Arguments.PageIndex]=0,'watermark1',Iif([Arguments.PageIndex]%2=0,'watermark2','watermark3'))"

Most of the reporting controls (for example, Table, TableCell, CheckBox, etc.) supports the Bookmark property. Set the same label's Parent Bookmark property to the label in the group band. This arranges bookmarks into a parent-child structure reflecting the report elements' hierarchy in the Document Map.

You can add a cross-reference for a report control by setting the following properties: Set the Navigation Target property to _self to specify that the link is in the same document. Set the Navigation Url property to the target control's Name property value. In this case, the control behaves like a link meaning that the cursor automatically changes to a hand in a report's preview when hovering the control. You can make a control resemble a link by specifying its appearance properties (for example, change the text's color to blue and underline it).

    "keywords": "Specify Query Parameters This document provides general information on query parameters and describes common ways of utilizing parametrized SQL queries to filter data at the data source level. Query Parameters Overview A query parameter holds an external value that is inserted into an SQL statement before query execution. This value can be either static or dynamically generated by an associated expression. The query parameter value is inserted into the resulting SQL query string in the \"@QueryParameterName\" placeholder's position. Query parameters are used in the following scenarios: When filtering report data at the data source level using the Query Builder. The Query Builder helps you construct SQL queries when creating a new data-bound report or binding an existing report to an SQL data source, You can add queries to an existing SQL data source or edit existing queries: You can filter the constructed queries using query parameters. Expand the Parameters section in the Query Builder to add a new query parameter. Expand the Query Properties section and click the Filter property's ellipsis button to invoke the Filter Editor and filter data using the created query parameters. The criteria based on the specified query parameters are added as an SQL statement's WHERE part. When binding a report to a stored procedure provided by an SQL data source. The Data Source Wizard include the following page. If you select a stored procedure, the wizard creates a query parameter for each procedure parameter and allows you to configure the query parameters in the next Configure query parameters page. Configure Query Parameters The following properties are available for each query parameter: Name - specifies the parameter's name. Type - specifies the parameter value's data type. Expression - determines whether the actual parameter value is static or generated dynamically. Value - determines the query parameter's actual value. If the Expression option is enabled, the actual parameter value is produced dynamically by calculating an associated expression. This is useful when you map the query parameter value to the report parameter value. Refer to the next document section for more information. Provide the Query Parameter Value Below, you can see how a value is specified for a query parameter within the Data Source Wizard's page. You can also specify query parameter values in the Report Wizard or the Query Parameters dialog in the same way. Specifying a static value Choose a query parameter's value type and set a static value to the Value property according to the selected type. Providing a dynamic value Create a complex expression by expanding the Type property's drop-down list and selecting Expression. Click the Value property's ellipsis button and construct an expression in the invoked Expression Editor. You can map a report parameter that already exists in a report to a query parameter. Pass a Multi-Value Parameter Value to a Query You can map multi-value parameters to query parameters. For instance, the following query selects the orders whose IDs can be found within the values the @OrderID query parameter provides. Pass a Multi-Value Report Parameter Value to a Stored Procedure You cannot pass a multi-value parameter value to a stored procedure directly. Use one of the following expression functions: Use the Join() expression function to convert the array of parameter values to a string if you use MS SQL Server, MySQL or Oracle database systems. Use the CreateTable() expression function to prepare a table using values of several multi-value parameters."

    "keywords": "Invoices This tutorial describes how to create a simple invoice report displaying information about customers and their orders. You can perform similar steps to create various invoice layouts depending on your requirements. Create a Report and Bind It to Data Create a new report or open an existing one. Invoke the designer menu and click Add Data Source.... Select Database on the first page of the invoked Data Source Wizard and click Next. Select a data connection on the next page. On the same page, you can choose which tables, views and/or stored procedures to add to the report. Obtain data from two different tables to display information about customers and orders at the same hierarchical level in the report. Click the plus button for the Queries category to create a custom query. In the invoked Query Builder, add the required data tables to a query and join them based on a key column. On the same wizard page, select the data view providing order details for listing products included in each order in the invoice. On the same page, specify a master-detail relationship between the queries. Select the required key fields (columns) to connect tables. Click Finish to complete the wizard. After these steps, make sure that an appropriate data member is assigned to the report. Prepare the Master Report Layout Create the master report layout to display basic information about customers and their orders. Switch to the Field List and drop the required data fields onto the Detail band. New controls of appropriate types are automatically created and bound to the corresponding fields. Drop Label controls from the Toolbox onto the band to display static captions for specific data fields. Double-click the added labels one after another and enter the required text. Use the Line control to separate data. Prepare the Detail Report Layout Perform the following steps to create a detail report and construct its layout to show the order details in a tabular form: From the the report's context menu, select the Insert Detail Report Band command to create a Detail Report Band. Select the Detail Report band and select the master-detail relationship's name in the Data Member property's drop-down list. Add dynamic content to the detail report. Go to the Field List, select the data fields while holding down CTRL or SHIFT and drag-and-drop them onto the Detail band. This automatically creates a Table control with table cells bound to the corresponding fields. You should drag-and-drop fields from the category corresponding to the master-detail relationship to correctly generate the detail report's data. Add the Group Header band to the detail report to display captions for table columns. Select the Detail Report band and click Insert Group Header Band in the context menu. To create column headers, drop the Table control from the Toolbox onto the Group Header band and enter the required text in the table's cells. Select the Detail Report band, expand the Behavior category and set the band's Page Break property to After the Band to print each order on a separate page. Create a Calculated Field This section demonstrates how to create a custom field whose values are calculated using a pre-defined expression. Do the following to evaluate an extended price based on the price, quantity and discount values obtained from a database: In the Field List, select the detail table and click Add calculated field. Click the Edit button for the calculated field and change its name to ExtendedPrice. Click the Expression property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Expression Editor, construct the expression based on the UnitPrice, Quantity and Discount fields. You can use the created calculated field as an ordinary data field. Add a cell to a table in the Detail band and drop the calculated field onto this cell. Additionally, create one more table cell in the Group Header for displaying the corresponding caption. Format Data The next step is to specify report elements' value formatting to improve displaying their incoming data. In the master report's Detail band, select controls bound to date fields while holding down CTRL. Switch to the Properties panel, expand the Data category and click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Format String Editor, activate the DateTime category and select the format, for example, display dates as a month (name) followed by the day (number) and year (four digits). Select the table cell bound to the Discount data field in the detail report's Detail band. Expand the Cell Tasks category, click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Format String Editor, apply the Percent format. In this case, field values are multiplied by 100 and displayed with a percent symbol. In the detail report's Detail band, select the cells bound to the UnitPrice and ExtendedPrice fields. Invoke the Format String Editor once again and choose the format preset from the Currency category (for instance, c2). Calculate a Summary Do the following to calculate a total price for each order as a sum of Extended Price values: Add the Group Footer band to the detail report in the same way as the Group Header. Drop the Label control onto the added band and expand the Label Tasks category in the Properties panel. Select the Summary section and set the Running property to Report to calculate the summary for the entire detail report and click the Expression property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Expression Editor, specify the following expression to calculate the total price: Use the Text Format String property to format the summary's value (for instance, set it to Total: {0:c2}). Sort Data Perform the following steps to sort data in the detail report: Select the Detail band in the detail report. Select the Sort Fields section in the Detail Tasks category and add a new sort field to sort the detail report's data by the required data field. Click the or buttons to define the sort order within the group (ascending or descending). Use the button to disable sorting in grouped data. Customize the Report Appearance Do the following to customize the report and its elements' appearance: Click the gray area around the design surface to select the report, and in the Properties panel, specify the font settings. These settings are distributed to all report elements. You can adjust a control's font independently from its parent (for instance, make summary values bold). Change specific controls' (bound to date fields, price fields, etc.) text alignment using the Text Alignment property. Create a global visual style to apply it afterwards to multiple controls. Switch to the Report Explorer panel, select the Styles node and click the plus button to add a new report visual style. Select the created style and click the Properties button in the Report Explorer. This opens the Properties panel where you can adjust the settings of the selected style. Select report elements, expand the Styles category and choose a style in the Style property's drop-down list to apply the style to the selected elements. You can provide different appearances to alternating (odd and even) table rows in the detail report. Select the table and expand the Styles property in the Property Grid. Invoke the drop-down list for the EvenStyle property and select New. Specify the created style's appearance settings (for example, background color). Add Additional Information Do the following to provide additional information to your invoices, such as the report name and current date: Add the Page Header band to the master report to display the required information on each invoice page. Drop the Label control from the Toolbox onto the Page Header, double-click the control and type \"Invoice\". Specify the required appearance settings (font, foreground color, etc.). Add the Page Info control to the Page Header band to display system date in the report. Expand the Page Info Tasks category and set the Page Information property to Current Date and Time. Click the Text Format String property's ellipsis button, and in the invoked Format String Editor, select a date format as in the Format Data section above. View the Result The invoice report is now ready. Switch to Print Preview to see the result."

Settings To access the multi-column settings of a report's Detail band, switch to the Properties panel and expand the Detail Tasks or the Behavior category. Mode Enables you to select one of the following modes: None Disables the multi-column layout. Use Column Count Makes the report display a specific number of columns based on the Column Count value. When this property is set to 1, the report looks as though its multi-column layout is disabled. Use Column Width Makes the report columns have a specific width based on the Column Width value. With this setting, the report displays as many columns as it is possible according to the specified column width, column spacing and report page size. Column Spacing Specifies the distance between adjacent columns. This value is measured in report units. Layout Specifies the preferred direction for arranging report data within columns. First Across, then Down The report data is arranged horizontally and is wrapped to the next row on reaching the right page margin. When the report data is grouped, the multi-column layout is applied to each group individually. First Down, then Across The report data is arranged vertically and is wrapped to the next column on reaching the bottom page margin. When the report data is grouped, you can make each group start on a new column by setting the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band. How It Works The following image illustrates a report designer with a multi-column layout applied to the report: In multi-column mode, the report's design surface is limited to the area defined by the column width. This is the only area intended to contain report controls. The rest of this surface defines the space on a page remaining for printing columns and column spacing area. In the above image, the report data in the Detail band is contained within a Panel that provides borders around the enclosed content. You can also specify a custom background color for the Panel. To learn how to change this color dynamically (based on the report's underlying data), see Conditionally Change a Control's Appearance. When the report data is grouped (as in the above image), and the First Down, then Across multi-column layout is used, you can make each group start on a new column. To do this, set the Page Break property of the Group Footer to After the Band or After the Band, Except for the Last Entry. When there is no data to display in the Group Footer, set the band height to zero."

Design a Report in Report Wizard Create a new report or open an existing one. Open the Web Report Designer's menu. Select Design in Report Wizard. In the invoked Report Wizard, select Vertical Report and click Next. Select a data source for the report. Select queries and data fields to include in the report. Add summary fields. Select data fields: Add summary fields: Specify page settings (Landscape orientation) and set the title (Profit and Loss). Click Finish to open the generated report in the Report Designer. The wizard adds report controls to the following bands: Vertical Header band Contains a table with a single column that displays data field headers. Vertical Details band Contains a table with a single column that is printed as many times as there are records in the report's data source. Vertical Total band Contains a table with a single column that has as many labels in cells as there are summary functions you specified for each field in the Report Wizard. Switch to the Preview mode to see the result. Tip You can create a vertical report without using the Report Wizard. Click Insert Vertical Header Band from the report's context menu. Refer to the Introduction to Banded Reports topic for more information. Set Vertical Table Options You can set the following options to modify the vertical table: Set the Vertical Header band's Repeat Every Page property to false to display field headers once - on the first report page. Set the Vertical Detail band's Band Layout property to Across Then Down to print the data records that do not fit a page on the same page, otherwise, they are printed on the next page. Add a field to the Sort Fields group to sort the report's data."

    "keywords": "Appearance Properties This document describes the purpose and implementation of the appearance properties - a special set of properties that allow you to customize the appearance of a report or any of its elements. Properties Overview Every report element (control or band), and a report itself, has a set of properties that specify its appearance. They are listed in the following table. Property name Description BackgroundColor Gets or sets a background color to a report element and its child controls. BorderColor Gets or sets a border color to a report element and its child controls. BorderDashStyle Gets or sets a border dash style to a report element and its child controls. Borders Gets or sets borders (top, right, bottom,left), which should be visible for a report element and its child controls. BorderWidth Gets or sets a border width to a report element and its child controls. Font Gets or sets the font options (its name, size, etc.) to a report element and its child controls. ForegroundColor Gets or sets the foreground color to a report element and its child controls. Padding Gets or sets the indent values which are used to render the contents of a report element and its child controls. TextAlignment Gets or sets the text alignment to a report element and its child controls. Access Appearance Properties Use the Report Designer's Properties panel to access the appearance properties. Property Value Inheritance By default, appearance properties for every control or a band are set to empty values, which means that their real values are obtained from a control's parent, or a parent of its parent and so on. Note The appearance properties may not be used by all descendants of the current report element for which they are defined. For example, the PageBreak element ignores the BackColor property. To reset values of these properties, click the button to the right of the editor, and in the invoked popup menu, select Reset. Then, the control's actual appearance will be determined by the appropriate properties settings of its parent. If a report element has a style assigned to it, the priority of the properties defined by this style is determined by the StylePriority property. Note that when a conditional formatting is involved, the appearance it defines is of greater priority than the properties described above."

Use the Report Explorer Switch to the Report Explorer panel, select the Styles node and click the plus button to add a new report visual style. To access the collection of added report visual styles, expand the Styles category in the Report Explorer. Assign a Style to a Report Element Drag a report style from the Report Explorer onto a report control. This assigns the style to the report element's Style property. Assign Odd and Even Styles You can use the Odd Style and Even Style properties to apply different styles to alternating rows in a report. Customize a Style Select a style and click the Properties button in the Report Explorer. This opens the Properties panel where you can adjust the settings of the selected style. All the report elements apply the updated style immediately. Style Inheritance Nested elements inherit their parent element's style if they do not have an applied style. Override Styles You can specify a different value for a report element's appearance property to override the corresponding property value in the report element's style. Note If you apply conditional formatting, its appearance property values have a higher priority than both the individually specified properties and the style's properties."

    "keywords": "Introduction to Banded Reports Report Bands A report layout consists of bands that contain report controls and define their location on document pages. A blank report contains the following bands: The Detail Band displays recurring contents from the report's data source. This band is printed as many times as there are records available in a data source unless you filtered the data. Every report must have a detail band, and you cannot delete it. The top and bottom page Margin bands. These bands are repeated once on every document page. You can also add the following bands: Report Header and Report Footer The Report Header is the report's first band (margins are \"out-of-page\" zones). Use this band to display the report's name, company logo, date of creation, username, etc. The Report Footer is placed before the Page Footer and Bottom Margin on the report's last page. You can use the Report Footer band for report summaries or conclusions. Page Header and Page Footer These bands are at the top and bottom of every page in a report. They display information that should be printed on every page. Group Header and Group Footer These bands are above and below each group. Tip Only the detail and group bands can be used to display dynamic data source contents. Other bands display titles, summaries, and extra information. The following image illustrates a sample report layout and the Report Explorer panel that reflects the report's structure: Add a Detail Band to a Master-Detail Band Use the detail report band to create hierarchical master-detail reports. Detail report bands provide detailed information about each record in the master report's detail band. You can create such reports when master-detail relationships are defined between data source tables: A detail report band is a separate report (subreport) with its own data source and different bands. A report can have any number of detail reports that can also be nested. The following image illustrates a master-detail report and the Report Explorer panel that reflects the report's structure: Vertical Bands You can replace the Detail band with the Vertical Header, Vertical Detail and Vertical Total bands to display record fields vertically and print data records horizontally - from left to right. Note If your report's Detail band contains report controls, this band and all these controls are lost when you add a vertical band (the same behavior takes place in the opposite situation). The following vertical bands are available: Vertical Header Contains headers of the report's data fields. These headers are arranged one after another in a vertical direction. Vertical Details Displays recurring contents from the report's data source. This band is printed as many times as there are available records in a data source, unless you filtered the data. The records are displayed one after another in a horizontal direction. Vertical Total This band is placed at the rightmost position (leftmost when RTL is enabled). You can use the Vertical Total band for report summaries or conclusions. Tip See Vertical Reports for details on how to use vertical bands. Create Band Copies You can create functional copies of a band, for example, to display different contents based on a specific condition. To do this, add sub-bands to bands. Tip See Laying out Dynamic Report Contents for details on how to specify the location of bands' content on document pages. Manage Report Bands Collapse Bands in the Report Designer Select a band and click on the band's tab title to collapse or expand the band. Hide Bands in the Report Document You can avoid printing a band's content in a document. To do this, set the band's Visible property to false. Select the band and set this property in the Properties Panel. Remove Bands Select a band on the report design surface and press DELETE. This removes the band and all its content. Add Bands To add a band, select the report or any of its bands on Designer Surface, right-click to invoke the context menu and select a band."

    "keywords": "Edit Content in Print Preview This document provides information about interactive document editing in Print Preview that enables you to customize field values directly in a previewed document before printing or exporting it. Content Editing Overview When content editing is enabled for a report control (either unbound or data-aware), it is possible to customize the corresponding field values in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a report control, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes. When the Enabled property is set to Yes and the ReadOnly property is set to No, the control's content can be edited in Print Preview (clicking a field will invoke the appropriate editor). To highlight all editing fields available in a document, click the Editing Fields button on the Print Preview toolbar. This button is disabled when there are no such fields in a document. Content Editing Specifics When enabling content editing in your report, consider the following. The changes made to a control's content in Print Preview have no effect on other parts of the document (e.g., the related summary results, grouping, sorting, bookmarks and other settings that have already been processed before generating the document). A control's Can Grow setting is ignored for editing fields. Multi-line values can only be entered when no mask is applied to an editing field. The editing area of a field cannot exceed the original dimensions of a control. Values entered into editing fields are reset back to their defaults after refreshing the document (e.g., when submitting report parameter values and expanding or collapsing data in a drill-down report). It is impossible to edit content of a control that has its Drill-Down Control property specified. Field values entered in Print Preview for controls placed onto the Top Margin and Bottom Margin bands are not preserved when the report is exported to TXT or CSV, as well as the following formats as a single file. HTML MHT RTF XLS XLSX image To learn about the specifics of editing different kinds of content, see the following sections in this document. Text Editors Character Comb Editors Check Box Editor Image Editors Text Editors The Label, Table Cell and Character Comb controls can be assigned editors to customize their content in Print Preview. To enable content editing for these controls, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes. The following editors can be used to customize a field's content in Print Preview. Default Editor By default, the Editor Name property is not specified, and a memo edit is used as a standard editor. Specific Value Editors You can assign a specific editor to a control using its Editor Name property. Note This option is disabled for the Character Comb control. Note If a table cell contains other controls, its editing is disabled (but not the editing of the controls contained in this cell), which is illustrated in the following image. Character Comb Editors The Character Comb control displays text so that each character is printed in an individual cell. Specify the Character Comb's Edit Options | Editor Name property to use a text editor, as described in the Text Editors section above. Check Box Editor The Check Box control's value can be edited in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a check box, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes. In Print Preview, the control's behavior depends on the Group ID setting. When this property is set to null or an empty string value, a check box can be switched either to the \"checked\" or \"unchecked\" state (the \"intermediate\" state is not supported) independently on other available check boxes. Otherwise, the field editor behaves like a radio button, and editors with the same Group ID value belong to a single logical group (i.e., only one option can be selected within a group at a time). Image Editors Image editors are used to customize the Picture Box report control's content in Print Preview. To enable content editing for a picture box, expand the Behavior category, select the Edit Options section and set the Enabled property to Yes. Use the control's Editor Name property to assign one of the following image editors. Image Editor Allows you to load an image and specify the image's size options. Signature Editor Allows you to specify brush options and draw a signature. Image and Signature Editor (default) Allows you to load an image and draw a signature. The image's size options and brush options are available. All the image editors listed above can include the menu item. This item is available only when the Picture Box control has an original image.

Sort Report Groups To enable sorting report groups in Print Preview, select the label displaying product category names located in the Group Header band and switch to the Properties panel. Expand the Behavior category, select the Interactive Sorting section, and set the Target Band property to GroupHeader1. Set the Field Name property to CategoryName. Switch to the Preview tab to sort report groups by the CategoryName field. When a mouse pointer hovers over the category name, it changes to a hand indicating the sorting capability. The arrow displayed at the element's right edge indicates the sorting order. Sort Detail Data To enable sorting data in the Detail band, select the table cell displaying the Product Name title and switch to the Properties panel. Set the Target Band property to Detail and expand the Sort Fields section and add a new sort field to sort detail data by the product name. Set the table cell's Field Name property to the ProductName field. On switching to the Preview tab, you can now sort data in the Detail band by the ProductName field. If you provide interactive sorting to multiple fields, clicking another field clears all the previously applied data sorting. Hold the SHIFT key while clicking to preserve the existing sorting settings and thus sort against multiple fields. To disable data sorting against a specific field, hold the CTRL key on its caption click. Note Reports embedded into the current report using the Subreport control do not support interactive data sorting."

If a property's editor displays an ellipsis button, you can click this button to invoke the Expression Editor and specify an expression that evaluates to the property's value. The Expression Editor offers a choice of functions, operators, data source fields, report elements, constants, and variables to create an expression. An expression can span multiple lines. You can add single-line or multi-line comments in the following format: /* comment text */. The Expression Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (it suggests functions and available data elements as you type). An error icon appears if an expression contains errors. Hover the mouse pointer over this icon to invoke a pop-up notification that shows the location of the error. See the Expression Language topic for the expression syntax description. Expression Syntax Take into account the following syntax conventions when using the Expression Editor: Reference a data field in the expression by enclosing its name in the square brackets (for example, [ProductName]). Insert report parameters and query parameters by typing a question mark before their names (for instance, ?parameter1). Denote string values with apostrophes. Type a double apostrophe to embed an apostrophe into an expression's text (for example, 'It''s sample text'). Enclose date-time constants with hashtags ([OrderDate] >= #1/1/2016#). Use a question mark to specify a null reference (one that does not refer to any object) ([Region] != ?). If an expression involves the use of different types, you can convert them to the same type using dedicated functions (for instance, Max(ToDecimal([Quantity]),[UnitPrice])). Using the Expression Editor When expression bindings are enabled in your reports, the Report Designer contains the Expressions tab allowing you to assign values to various element properties. Clicking any property's ellipsis button invokes the Expression Editor, in which you can specify custom expressions with the available data fields. In the data binding mode, you can use the Expression Editor in the following cases: Edit a Calculated Field's Expression Access a calculated field's settings in the Field List and click Expression property's ellipsis button. Specify a Query Parameter's Value In the Configure Query Parameters wizard page, set the parameter type to Expression and click the Value property's the ellipsis button.

Select Tables Drag and drop a specific table or view onto the Query Builder design surface to include it into a query result set. The Query Builder provides a toolbar with the following commands: Icon Description Removes the selected table or view from the query. Reverses the most recent action. Performs the previously undone action. Enable check boxes for the table columns you want to include into the query result set. Use the search box to find a table or view by name. Join Tables The Query Builder allows you to join tables and/or views. Use drag and drop to connect corresponding columns (key fields). The connected columns should have identical data types. Click the data relation to display the Relation Properties section. Properties in this section define the join type (Inner or Left Outer) and applied logical operator. A left outer join returns all the values from an inner join along with all values in the \"left\" table that do not match to the \"right\" table and includes rows with NULL (empty) values in the key field. If you select the left outer join, the relationship line displays an arrow which points at the \"right\" table of the join clause. The executed query returns a \"flat\" table which joins different tables within a single query. The specified join options define which data records compose the query result set. Note We recommend you to use hierarchical data sources because the reporting engine generates master-detail reports faster than similar-looking reports which obtains data from \"flat\" data sources. Filter Data Expand the Query Properties section to display the query options. The query provides the following options: Name Specifies a custom query name (alias). Filter Runs the Filter Editor where you can specify filter conditions for the resulting data. Filter criteria may contain query parameters. Group Filter Runs the Filter Editor where you can specify filter conditions for grouped and aggregated data. This option is enabled only for grouped data. Select All (*) Specifies whether to include all columns from the selected tables and/or views to the query result set, regardless of their individual settings. The default value is No. Select Top Specifies the number of first records to include to the query result set. The default value is 0 and indicates that the query result set contains all records that meet all other filter conditions. Offset Specifies the number of records to skip before the report engine retrieves data. This option is available only for sorted data. Select distinct Specifies whether to include only distinct values to the result set. The default value is No. Shape Data Select a table or view and click a data column to display the data column options. The Column Properties section contains the following options: Name Indicates the column name which the Query Builder obtains from the database. Type Indicates the column's data type. The Query Builder provides information about the maximum string length for string columns. Alias Specifies a custom column name (alias). Include a column into a query to enable this option. Output Specifies whether to include the column into the query result set. Sort Type Specifies whether to preserve the original data records' order within the column, or sort them (in an ascending or descending order). Sort Order Apply sorting to the data column's records to enable this option. It defines the sorting priority for multiple columns (the less this number is, the higher the priority). For example, set the sort order to 1 for the column A and set it to 2 for the column B. The Query Builder first sorts the query by column A and then by the column B. All columns' sort order automatically updates when you change this setting for one column. It allows you to avoid conflict of priorities. Group By Specifies whether to group the query result set by this column. Note You should apply grouping and/or aggregation to each selected column. Aggregate Specifies whether to aggregate the column's data records. You can use the following aggregate functions: Count, Max, Min, Avg, Sum, CountDistinct, AvgDistinct, SumDistinct. The Query Builder discards individual data records from the query result set and keep only the aggregate function result when you apply any of these functions. Note Use aggregation/grouping either for all selected columns or for none of them. The Query Builder applies grouping to all selected columns automatically if you apply the aggregation to one column. The Query Builder resets grouping against other columns when you remove all aggregation functions. Use Query Parameters Use the Parameters section to add, remove and edit query parameters. Each query parameter provides the following properties: Name Specifies the query parameter's name. Type Specifies the parameter value's data type. Set this property to Expression to generate parameter values dynamically. Result Type Specifies the data type of the expression's result value. This property is enabled if the query parameter's type is Expression. Value Determines the query parameter's actual value. You can specify a static actual value according to the selected value's data type. Alternatively, construct an expression to generate actual parameter values dynamically. Click this property's ellipsis button to invoke the Expression Editor and create an expression. This ellipsis button is enabled if you set the query parameter's type to Expression. Preview Results Click the Preview Results button to test a query on the actual data's limited subset at any time. The opened Data Preview screen displays the first 100 data records of the query result set."

    "keywords": "Script Editor Important Both the execution of all report scripts and the capability to view and edit scripts in the Web Report Designer are disabled by default for security reasons. Make sure that your software vendor allows you to use scripts. The Script Editor allows you to write code for specific event handlers in the End-User Report Designer to adjust the behavior of report controls, bands, or a report itself. This topic describes the basic principles of using scripts, the Script Editor interface and shows how scripting can be used in a report. Overview Scripts are program commands, placed within the event handlers of the required report elements. And, when the corresponding event occurs (e.g. a mouse click), the script code runs. You can write scripts for a report or any of its elements (bands and controls), to be executed when the report is being previewed, printed or exported. The Script Editor provides you the capability to write and execute scripts. Use this editor if you want to slightly customize a report in the End-User Report Designer. The Script Editor supports C#, Visual Basic .NET and JScript .NET scripting languages. This means that the scripting language is independent from the language used to create the report. The language is specified by the Script Language property. The selected scripting language must be the same for all scripts used in a report. The Script Editor supports intelligent code completion that makes it easier and faster to write scripts. Context-aware hints are displayed on pressing CTRL+spacebar. This feature is only supported for the C# and Visual Basic .NET script languages. Intelligent code completion is available only for .NET Framework and DevExpress libraries deployed with the application and cannot be provided for custom assemblies. Maintaining Scripts Each report element has its own set of events that can be handled by the Script Editor. To handle an event of a report element, do the following. Click the Scripts button located on the End-User Report Designer's Main Toolbar. In the displayed Script Editor, specify the report control and its event by the toolbar. The toolbar contains all scripts written for all report elements, and allows you to quickly navigate through them by choosing the required report element in the corresponding drop-down list and specifying one of its available events in another menu. After the event is specified, a code template is generated in the current scripting language. To check for errors in the report's script, click the Validate button. If an error is found, the string containing this error is marked with an icon. When a mouse pointer hovers over this icon, the text of the error is displayed."

Expand the Summary section in the Label Tasks category and set the Running property to Group. Click the Expression property's ellipsis button. This invokes the Expression Editor where you can specify a custom expression with multiple built-in functions from the Functions | Summary section.

    "title": "Calculated Fields Overview | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "Calculated Fields Overview Calculated fields allow you to pre-process a report's input data, based on a certain expression. So, using calculated fields allows you to apply complex expressions to one or more data fields that are obtained from your report's underlying data source. Moreover, you can both group and sort your report data based on a calculated field's value. Calculated Fields Overview To create a calculated field, switch to the Field List, select a data table and click Add calculated field. Click the Edit button for the calculated field to display calculated field properties. Click the Expression property's ellipsis button. In the invoked Expression Editor, construct the required expression. You can use data fields, report parameters, predefined constants as well as various date-time, logical, math and string functions. See the next document section for more information about expression syntax. Note The Expression Editor displays only those data fields that are obtained from a data source specified by the calculated field's Data Source and Data Member property values. Switch to the Properties Panel, select the Data category and expand the Calculated Fields section to display the calculated fields collection and manage its items. You can drag the calculated field from the Field List onto the required band like an ordinary data field. You can also group and sort your report data based on the calculated field values. Expression Syntax A data field is inserted into the expression's text using its name in [square brackets], and parameters are inserted using the \"?\" prefix before their names. A calculated field's expression can evaluate the values of other calculated fields if you make sure to avoid circular references. Date-time constants must be wrapped in hashtags (#) (e.g., [OrderDate] >= #1/1/2009#). To represent a null reference (one that does not refer to any object), use a question mark (e.g., [Region] != ?). To denote strings, use apostrophes ('), otherwise an error will occur. To embed an apostrophe into an expression's text, it should be preceded by another apostrophe (e.g., 'It's sample text'). The type of a value returned by a calculated field is defined by its Field Type property. If a calculated field expression involves the use of different types, it is necessary to convert them to the same type (e.g., Max(ToDecimal([Quantity]),[UnitPrice])) Although a value that is returned by a calculated field is usually converted to a string (to be displayed in a text-aware report control), it can return a value of any kind. For example, if a database field contains an image, you can set a calculated field's expression to \"=...\", after which this calculated field can be bound to the Picture Box control. To construct a valid aggregate expression, use the following format, which consists of four parts. [<Collection>][<Condition>].<Aggregate>(<Expression>) <Collection> - Specifies a collection against which an aggregated value should be calculated. It can be the relationship name in a case of a master-detail relationship, or the name of a collection property exposed by the target class. For example, [CategoriesProducts][[CategoryId]>5].Count(). Empty brackets [] indicate the root collection. <Condition> - Specifies a condition defining which records should participate in calculating an aggregate function. To obtain an aggregated value against all records, delete this logical clause along with square brackets (for example, [].Count()). <Aggregate> - Specifies one of the available aggregate functions. <Expression> - Specifies an expression evaluating values to be used to perform calculation. For example, [][[CategoryID] > 5].Sum([UnitPrice]*[Quantity]). The Count function does not require field values to count the records, so leave the round brackets empty for this function.

    "keywords": "Data Binding Modes The Report Designer works in one of the following data binding modes: Expressions is the default binding mode. This mode enables you to specify complex expressions that include two or more data fields, report parameters, or functions. You can also use expressions to calculate summaries of any complexity or conditionally shape your data. Click a property's marker to see whether the invoked context menu has the PropertyName Expression item that invokes the Expression Editor. The Expression Editor allows you to use functions, access report bands and controls, and reference data source values in the constructed expression. Expressions Advanced is the advanced Expression mode. This mode enables you to specify an expression that is evaluated within a control's specific event. The Expression Editor allows you to use event argument values in the constructed expressions. Event arguments are available in the Variables section. In the BeforePrint event, you can use data fields from all queries in the data source. In the PrintOnPage event, data source fields are not available because data was fetched when this event occurs. You can use the event arguments that are available in the Variables section."

    "keywords": "Expression Language This section describes the report-specific expression syntax. Expression Syntax An expression is a text string that specifies what data to take and how to process it to obtain a value. For instance, the following expression returns an integer value of 5: 3 + 2 An expression string can consist of multiple lines that include constants, operators, function calls, fields or parameters, report items, and comments: /* This expression is set for the Visible property of a control to show/hide the control based on the ShowTotalAmount parameter value. */ Iif ( ?ShowTotalAmount == True, True, False ) Constants String constants Wrap string constants in apostrophes. If a string contains an apostrophe, double the apostrophe. [Country] == 'France' [Name] == 'O''Neil' Date-time constants Wrap date-time constants in '#'. [OrderDate] &gt;= #2018-03-22 13:18:51.94944# True The Boolean True value. [InStock] == True False The Boolean False value. [InStock] == False Enumeration Specify an enumeration value by its underlying integer value. [Status] == 1 Guid Wrap a Guid constant in curly braces. Use Guid constants in a relational operation with equality or inequality operators only. [OrderID] == {513724e5-17b7-4ec6-abc4-0eae12c72c1f} Numeric Specify numeric constant types in a string form by suffixes: Int32 (int) - 1 Int16 (short) - 1s Byte (byte) - 1b Double (double) - 1.0 Single (float) - 1.0f Decimal (decimal) - 1.0m Value Suffix Example 32-bit integer No suffix [CategoryID] == 1 16-bit integer s [CategoryID] == 1s Byte b [CategoryID] == 1b Double-precision floating-point number No suffix [Length] == 1.0 Single-precision floating-point number f [Length] == 1.0f Decimal floating-point number m [Price] == 25.0m ? A null reference that does not refer to any object. We recommend that you use the IsNull unary operator (for example, \"[Region] is null\") or the IsNull logical function (for example, \"IsNull([Region])\") instead of ?. [Region] != ? Operators + Adds the value of one numeric expression to another or concatenates two strings. [UnitPrice] + 4 [FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName] - Finds the difference between two operands. [Price1] - [Price2] * Multiplies the value of two operands. [Quantity] * [UnitPrice] / Divides the first operand by the second. [Quantity] / 2 % Divides one numeric operand by the other and returns the remainder (modulus). [Quantity] % 3 | Performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation on two numeric expressions. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If either bit is 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Number] | [Number] & The bitwise AND operator. Compares each bit of its first operand to the corresponding bit of its second operand. If the two bits are 1, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding resulting bit is set to 0. [Number] &amp; 10 ^ Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation on two numeric expressions. [Number] ^ [Number] == Returns True if both operands are equal; otherwise, it returns False. [Quantity] == 10 != Returns True if the operands are not equal; otherwise, it returns False. [Country] != 'France' < Less than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] &lt; 20 <= Less than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] &lt;= 20 >= Greater than or equal to operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] &gt;= 30 > Greater than operator. Used to compare expressions. [UnitPrice] &gt; 30 In (,,,) Tests for the existence of a property in an object. [Country] In ('USA', 'UK', 'Italy') Between (,) Specifies a range to test. Returns True if a value is greater than or equal to the first operand and less than or equal to the second operand. [Quantity] Between (10, 20) And (&&) Performs a logical conjunction on two Boolean expressions. [InStock] And ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) [InStock] &amp;&amp; ([ExtendedPrice]> 100) Or (||) Performs a logical disjunction on two Boolean expressions. [Country]=='USA' Or [Country]=='UK' [Country]=='USA' \\|| [Country]=='UK' ~ Performs a bitwise negation on a numeric expression. ~[Roles] = 251 Not (!) Performs a logical negation on a Boolean expression. Not [InStock] ![InStock] Returns a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). +[Value] = 10 Returns the negative of a numeric expression's value (a unary operator). -[Value] = 20 Is Null Returns True if an expression is a null reference (one that does not refer to any object). [Region] is null Operator Precedence When an expression contains multiple operators, these operators are evaluated in the following sequence: Literal values Parameters Identifiers OR (left-associative) AND (left-associative) The '.' relationship qualifier (left-associative) ==, != <, >, <=, >= -, + (left-associative) *, /, % (left-associative) NOT Unary - In Iif Trim(), Len(), Substring(), IsNull() '[]' (for set-restriction) '()' Group elements with parentheses to change operator precedence. For instance, operators are applied in the default order in the following expression: Accounts[Amount == 2 + 48 * 2] In the next expression, the addition operation is applied first, because its associated elements are grouped with parentheses, and the multiplication operation is applied last. Accounts[Amount == (2 + 48) * 2] Functions The expression language includes a set of functions that extend an expression's capabilities: Logical functions Date and time functions Math functions String functions Functions for expression bindings and calculated fields Functions for stored procedures Functions for the Summary Expression Editor You can also implement custom functions. See the following topic for a complete list of functions that are available in expressions: Functions in Expressions. Case Sensitivity Operators are case-insensitive. Case sensitivity of values can depend on the data source. For instance, SQL Server Express 2005 is configured as case-insensitive. In this case, the following filter expression always evaluates to True: Lower(Name) == Upper(Name) Escape Keywords You can mark a keyword-like field name with the @ escape character. In the expression below, the CriteriaOperator.Parse method interprets @Or as a field named Or, not the logical operator OR. @Or = 'value' Escape Characters Use a backslash (\\) as an escape character for characters in an expression, as shown below: \\[ \\\\ \\' Use an apostrophe (') as an escape character for string literals: 'A parameter''s value is:' + ?parameter1 Data Fields and Calculated Fields Enclose a data field or calculated field's name in square brackets ([ and ]): /* This expression is set for a control's Text property to bind the control to the UnitPrice data field. */ [UnitPrice] Ensure that the field with the specified name exists in the report's data source and data member. You can refer to data fields from a data member that is not specified as the report's data member (only the first record is returned): /* This expression is set for a control's Text property to bind the control to the UnitPrice data field from the Products data member (the report is not bound to Products). */ [Products].[UnitPrice] Report Parameters Use the following syntax to insert report parameters in an expression: Type a question mark before a parameter's name. ?parameter1 (Obsolete) Use the \"Parameters.\" prefix in front of a report parameter's name. [Parameters.parameter1] Enumerations Do one of the following to assign an enumeration value to a property: Specify an enumeration value by its underlying integer value. [Borders] = 1 The Expression Editor can help you specify a string value for built-in enumerations: Comments The expression language supports comments. For example: /* This is a comment within an expression. */ Comments start with the /* sequence and end at the matching */ sequence."

    "keywords": "Expressions Overview Use expressions to accomplish the following tasks: Retrieve data Format data values Create calculated fields Calculate summaries Specify conditions for report elements Specify conditions for data source queries How to Specify an Expression In the Report Designer, properties that support expressions have an f button in the Properties panel. Click this button to specify an expression in the invoked Expression Editor. In Expressions Advanced mode, the Report Designer allows you to specify expressions that are evaluated within specific events: The BeforePrint event where you can use data fields from all queries in the data source. The PrintOnPage event fetches the number of pages in the report and the current page. You can use these variables to specify conditions for report items. See the following topic for more information: Data Binding Modes. Expression Editor The Report Designer's Expression Editor has a graphical interface that allows you to create and edit expressions. Use one of the following ways to invoke the Expression Editor: Select a report, band, or control. The f button appears next to the selection. Click this button to invoke the Expression Editor. In the Properties window, if an expression can be set for a property, the f button appears near the value editor. Click this button to invoke the Expression Editor. The f button changes its color to blue to indicate that an expression is set for a property. The Editor lists all properties for which you can specify an expression. Click a property to specify an expression. An f icon appears next to a property where an expression is set. The Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (which suggests functions and available data elements as you type). The Expression Editor displays all the errors it finds in the specified expression. The Editor lists a tree with language elements and items that you can use in an expression. FilterString Editor You can use the Report Designer's FilterString Editor to specify the FilterString property of a report, Cross Tab, or Chart Series. The FilterString Editor's visual interface allows you to use an unlimited number of conditions and combine them with logical operators to create filter criteria. You can also switch to Text mode and type a filter string. The FilterString Editor highlights an expression's syntax and supports intelligent code completion (which suggests functions and available data elements as you type). Expression Syntax An expression can include field names, constants, operators, functions, data fields, and parameters. See the following topic for more information: Expression Language."

    "title": "How to: Use Expressions | DevExpress End-User Documentation",
    "keywords": "How to: Use Expressions This topic lists solutions to common expression-related tasks. Group Clauses with Brackets Use square brackets to specify a condition under which the expression should return the result. For instance, the following expression returns all Customers that have an account Date of 8/25/2006 and an account Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006#] && [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] Construct an expression as in the following example to search for all Customers that have an Account with both a Date of 8/25/2006 and an Amount of 100: [Accounts][[Date] == #8/25/2006# && [Amount] == 100] Calculate Group Summaries Use the ^ operator to specify an expression that calculates a group summary. Sum up the EFC field values in a group: [][[GroupFieldName] == [^.GroupFieldName]].Sum([EFC]) Specify the group header value: [][[CategoryID] == [^.CategoryID] and [ProductID] == [][[CategoryID] == [^.CategoryID]].Max([ProductID])].Max([ProductName]) Count the number of times a value occurs: The following expression counts how many times the value 12 occurs in the data source: [][[FootSize]='12'].Count() The following expression counts the number of records with non-zero values: [][[FootSize]!=0].Avg([FootSize]) Reference Report Items A report's elements are displayed in the Report Designer's Report Explorer. You can access these elements and their properties in an expression. The following example demonstrates how to set a label's BackColor property to another label's BackColor property value: [ReportItems].[xrLabel2].[BackColor] Note [ReportItems] is a plain list that provides access to all report items at one level. You cannot use the ReportItems collection in a Calculated Field's expression. Specify Images for Picture Boxes When you specify an expression for the Picture Box's Image Source property, you can use image Ids from the report's ImageResources collection. IIf([MarchSales]>20, [Images.ArrowUp],[Images.ArrowDown]) Use Row/Column Indexes for Cross Tab Cells Use the following variables to change a Cross Tab cell's appearance settings: Arguments.GroupColumnIndex Returns the index of a cell's column within a group. iif([Arguments.GroupColumnIndex] % 2 == 1, Rgb(235, 241, 252), ?) /* Result: The specified color applies an odd-even color style to the Cross Tab's columns. */ Arguments.GroupRowIndex Returns the index of a cell's row within a group. iif([Arguments.GroupRowIndex] % 2 == 1, Rgb(235, 241, 252), ?) /* Result: The specified color applies an odd-even color style to cross tab rows. */ Use Variables for Event-Related Expressions DataSource.RowCount Returns the total amount of data rows in a data source. [DataSource.RowCount] != 0 /* Result: When this expression is applied to a control's Visible property, the control is hidden if the data source contains no data. */ DataSource.CurrentRowIndex Returns an index of the current data row in a data source. Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowIndex] % 2 = 0, 'red', 'green') /* Result: When this expression is used for a table row's BackColor property, odd rows are colored in red, even rows are colored in green. */ DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel Returns a zero-based level of the current row in a hierarchical report. Iif([DataSource.CurrentRowHierarchyLevel] == 0, Rgb(231,235,244), ?) /* Result: When this expression is used for the BackColor property of the Detail band that is printed in tree mode, the root level rows are highlighted. */ Note These variables are not valid when the report includes a table of contents. Specify Parent Relations Use the '^' parent relation operator to refer to a parent in expressions that are written in the context of a child. You can apply this operator successively to span multi-level parent relationships. You can use this operator to refer to the currently processed report group. This allows you to calculate aggregates within groups, as shown in the following expression: [][[^.CategoryID] == [CategoryID]].Sum([UnitPrice]) Test Collection Elements Use brackets to check if a collection contains an element that meets a condition. The following expression returns true if the Accounts collection contains at least one element that meets the [Amount] == 100 condition: [Accounts][[Amount] == 100] The following expression returns false if the Accounts collection is empty: [Accounts][] Refer to the following topic for an example on how to use this syntax: Calculate an Aggregate Function."

Common Errors The following section explains how to work around the most frequently encountered errors related to the incorrect use of barcodes. The following error message is shown in place of the barcode if the control's dimensions are too small to fit the barcode with its specified resolution. To get rid of this error, enable the Auto Module property and/or increase the barcode's dimensions. The following error message appears when the data supplied to a barcode contains characters that are not supported by this barcode type. To avoid this error, supply data that applies to a particular barcode specification."

    "keywords": "Barcode Recognition Specifics This document describes the main specifics of barcode recognition and how to resolve the most frequently encountered issues when working with barcodes. Choose an Appropriate Barcode Type Selecting an appropriate barcode type (symbology) depends on your specific business requirements and the applied industrial standards. In general, consider using Barcode 2 of 5 Interleaved for encoding digits and Barcode 39 for encoding the full range of ASCII characters. Insert the Function Code Characters (FNC) or the Application Identifier into a Barcode Some encodings enable you to insert a special FNC1 character for separating application identifiers from the rest of the barcode. According to the GS1 specification, the FNC1 character is always inserted at the first position of the encoded data. Other identifiers can be inserted manually using the default \"#\" character. Although you can use any ASCII character as the FNC1 placeholder, it will not be a part of the encoded data as it does not have any direct ASCII representation. For the Code 128 symbology, you can also define FNC2-4 characters. For the list of the available application identifiers, refer to the official documentation at www.gs1.org. Specify the Barcode Resolution on Export to Third-Party Formats At present, only export to PDF preserves the original barcode in its vector form. Export to other formats will keep only the rasterized version of a barcode (with the default DPI set to 96). For XLSX and XLS export, the output resolution can be set up manually using the Rasterization Resolution property. Specify the DPI of the Device Used to Print the Bar Code The Target Device Dpi property allows you to specify the DPI of the device on which you wish to print your barcode. The XRBarCode control automatically adjusts bar density based on this property's value. Use the Target Device Dpi property to ensure that the bar code is scanned correctly on the target device. This is especially important if your printing device has a non-standard DPI setting. Common Issues This document section provides solutions to the most common issues that you may encounter when creating barcodes. The barcode is too \"dense\" The more information you wish to encode, the more bars should be drawn and the larger the barcode should become. The barcode's Module property specifies the width of the narrowest bar in a barcode. Although you can set this property to a very small value, the actual value is determined by the maximum resolution of your barcode printer device. Alternatively, consider using the Auto Module option to automatically calculate the optimal bar size based on the current barcode dimensions. Note When barcodes are \"dense\" and you are manually specifying the Module value, make sure that multiplying this value by the barcode printer resolution results in an integer number. Otherwise, rounding errors may occur on calculating the resulting bar width. For example, when the Module is set to 0.015 inches and the printer resolution is 300 DPI, their product equals 4.5, which may be rounded to 4 or 5 pixels for different bars and result in barcode recognition errors. In this case, the Module property should be set to 0.01333 (to make the bar width equal to 4 pixels) or to 0.01667 (to make the bar width equal to 5 pixels). The barcode is correctly displayed on the preview but it is not scanned Make sure that your scanner has been correctly set up to be able to recognize a specific kind of a barcode. If you are not certain about how to operate the scanner properly, please refer to its product manual. Avoid scanning barcodes from the monitor screen (e.g., using an application installed on your smartphone), because the screen DPI may not be sufficient to effectively recognize each particular bar. The barcode is correctly displayed on the preview but it is scanned incorrectly The cause for this problem may be an encoding issue specific to the \"binary\" input mode. By default, the UTF-16 encoding is used. However, your scanner device may use a different encoding model or even a codepage (i.e., a specific table that maps abstract values to real human-understandable characters). For additional information on this subject, please refer to the specification of your scanner device. The \"There are invalid characters in the text\" error occurs Different barcode symbologies define different ranges of allowed characters under different character sets. To avoid this error, please check the barcode specification."

To add a Character Comb to the report, drag the Character Comb item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. The number of cells displayed by the control in Print Preview depends on the Can Shrink and Auto Width settings. If both these properties are enabled, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters in the control's text. Otherwise, the number of cells corresponds to the specified cell size and the control size. See the Content Layout and Position section to learn more on using these properties. You can also adjust the character comb's size to match its characters using the Fit Bounds To Text command from the control's context menu: If the Word Wrap option is enabled, the command keeps control content displayed in multiple lines. It decreases the control's height and adjusts the width to fit this content. If the Word Wrap option is disabled, the command adjusts the control's height and width to completely display the control's content in a single line. As a result, the number of cells corresponds to the number of characters. When exporting this control to third-party formats, consider the following When a report is exported to an XLS or XLSX file, the cells of the Character Comb correspond to the cells of a resulting Excel sheet. When a report is exported to a CSV (or TXT) file, the content of individual cells is separated (or spaced) by a specified Separator character. In most aspects, the Character Comb is similar to the Label control from which it inherits most of its properties and its basic behavior. For general information about binding these controls to data and display summary function results, see the Label topic. To learn about Character Comb specifics, see the following sections in this document. Main Options The following properties are specific to the Character Comb control: Cell Vertical Spacing and Cell Horizontal Spacing Specify the spacing between adjacent cells (measured in report units). These values do not depend on the specified border width of a control. The following image illustrates a Character Comb with Cell Vertical Spacing set to 15 and Cell Horizontal Spacing set to 5. Border Width Specifies the width of cell borders in pixels, as a floating point value. When the cell spacing is set to zero, the borders of adjacent cells are merged (i.e., the actual border width is not doubled). The following images illustrate how cell spacing affects the Border Width property behavior: Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing = 1 When the control's content is to be printed on multiple pages, a page break horizontally splits the cell border based on the cell spacing setting, as shown below. Cell Spacing = 0 Cell Spacing > 0 Cell Size Mode Specifies whether or not the cell size should depend on the current font size of a control. The following cell size modes are supported: Custom The cell size is determined by the Cell Height and Cell Width property values and does not depend on the assigned font size. With this setting, the actual cell size is less than the specified Cell Height and CellWidth by the Border Width value. Auto Size The cell size depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height and Cell Width properties are ignored). With this setting, the actual cell size does not depend on the specified border width of a control. Auto Height Only the cell height depends on the current font size of a control (the Cell Height property is ignored), and the Cell Width value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell height does not depend on the specified border width of a control. The actual cell width is the difference between the specified Cell Width and Border Width values. Auto Width Only the cell width depends on the current font size of a control (the Сell Width property is ignored), and Cell Height value is specified manually. With this setting, the following behavior is expected: The actual cell width does not depend on the specified border width of a control. The actual cell height is the difference between the specified Cell Height and Border Width values. Content Layout and Position This section describes the Character Comb properties that affect the control's position on a page and content layout.

You can add this control by dragging the Page Break item from the Toolbox onto the report's area. This control is visually represented by a short line attached to the report's left margin. The Page Break control is useful when you need to insert a page break between controls within a report band (for example, to divide subreports so that the second subreport starts printing on a new page). You can also insert a page break before or after a specific report band using the band's Page Break property."

For examples of different uses of this control, see the corresponding tutorials: Add Page Numbers Display the User Name in a Report Display the Current Date and Time in a Report Note Because usually this information is displayed in the Page Header/Footer and Top/Bottom Margin bands, you cannot bind the Page Info property to a field from a data source. So, in order to display dynamic information, use the Label or Rich Text controls instead. In addition, a format string can be applied to a control's contents. For example, you can change the control's format to Page {0} of {1} using the Text Format String property. When a report contains at least one group, you can specify individual page numbers for report groups by setting the Running Band property to the name of the required group."

Refer to the following documentation section for more details: Embed PDF File Content into a Report. Add the PDF Content Control to a Report Drop the PDF Content item from the Toolbox onto a band on the design surface. Specify PDF Content Use one of the following methods: Specify binary PDF data This data is stored in the report file. The source of this data does not need to be available when the report is rendered. Specify a reference to a PDF document The reference to the document is stored in the report definition file. The referenced document should be available when the report is rendered. Specify PDF Data Select the PDF Content control, navigate to the Properties panel, click the Source property's ellipsis button, and select a PDF file. When users save a report, the Source property value persists in the report file. You can also use report parameters to conditionally specify the Source property value or bind the property to a data source field. Refer to the following section for details: Use Expressions. Specify a Reference to a PDF Document Select the PDF Content control, navigate to the Properties panel, and assign a path to a PDF file to this property. You can also use report parameters to conditionally specify the Source Url property value or bind the property to a data source field. Refer to the following section for details: Use Expressions. When users save a report, the URL or path specified in the Source URL property is included in the report file. The PDF document should be available at the specified location when a report is printed or rendered in Preview. The Source Url property value takes precedence over the Source property value. If you specify both properties, PDF Content includes the content specified by Source Url. If the file specified in the Source Url property cannot be loaded, the PDF data from the Source property is used. Use Expressions Select the PDF Content control and navigate to the Properties panel. Click the f symbol right to the Source or Source URL property. Use the invoked Expression Editor to create an expression that identifies the source of a PDF file. Embed PDF File Content into a Report Add the PDF Content control to a report, specify a PDF file location, and disable the control's Generate Own Pages property. Use Cases Create a report with PDF file content and headers / footers that are printed on PDF file pages. Print pictures, bar codes, page numbers, a report watermark, and other elements over the content of a PDF file. Create a report document with paper kind that differs from PDF pages paper kind. Refer to the following section for instructions: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Append PDF file content to report content and add sequential numbering to all report pages. For this, add PDF file content as a subreport to your report as described in the following section: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Then, add page numbers to both the subreport and main report. Design a pre-printed form and use PDF file as a watermark. If your PDF file contains one page, follow the steps below: Embed this page into a report's Detail band. Remove the report's margins to prevent duplication with PDF page margins. Adjust the page size to make it fit the entire Detail band. If your PDF file contains multiple pages, do the following: Create a subreport for each of the pages. Follow the instructions in this section: Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size. Use the PDF Content control's Page Range property to specify the PDF file page that should be included to a subreport. Include each of these subreports to one report. Fit PDF File's Page Size to Report's Page Size A PDF file and a report to which you embed PDF file content might have different paper kind. PDF file pages can also be generated with double margins: page margins and report margins. This section explains how to set the same paper kind for a report and its embedded PDF file and how to include only the PDF file's page margins to the report. The main idea is to create a subreport that includes PDF pages in embedded mode, and then, add this subreport to the main report that contains initial content. Create a blank report. Set the report's Paper Kind property to the paper kind of the main report to which you want to embed PDF content. Drop the PDF Content control from the Toolbox onto the created report's Detail band, specify a PDF file source, and disable the control's Generate Own Pages property. Remove the report's margins and adjust the PDF Content control size to make PDF content fit the entire Detail band. Add the report as a subreport to your main report. Use the Subreport control with the Generate Own Pages property enabled. Open the main report's Preview to show the result. Limitations PDF content is displayed as an image in Preview. Users cannot select text in PDF content. To allow users to select text, export the report to PDF. You cannot add the PDF Content control to the following bands: Top Margin / Bottom Margin Page Header / Page Footer Group Header / Group Footer bands (if their Repeat Every Page properties are enabled). Vertical Header / Vertical Detail / Vertical Total"

Bind the Sparkline to Data You can connect the sparkline to individual data without accessing a report's data source. Click the Data Source property's drop-down list and select the required data source. The sparkline uses the report's data source if you do not specify the DataSource property. After that, specify the Data Member property and set the Value Member property to a data field that provides point values for the sparkline. To create a new data source for a sparkline, click Add Data Source... in the Menu. This invokes the Data Source Wizard that allows you to set up a required data source. Adjust the Sparkline View The sparkline supports the Line, Area, Bar and WinLoss view types. The View property provides access to options that change the sparkline's appearance. Each view type has properties that define the extreme values' visibility: Highlight Start Point and Highlight End Point; Highlight Min Point and Highlight Max Point. Specific properties differ between view types, such as the Highlight Negative Points setting that is available only for the Bar sparkline.

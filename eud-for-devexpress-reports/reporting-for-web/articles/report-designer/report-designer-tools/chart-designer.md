# Chart Designer

## Chart Designer Overview

The **Chart Designer** allows you to quickly create and customize [charts](../use-report-elements/use-charts.md) in the [End-User Report Designer](../../report-designer.md).

The Chart Designer consists of three main parts that are described below.

## Chart Structure

The **Chart Structure** tree enables you to explore and manage a structure of a chart and its elements.

When you click a chart element in the tree, the designer's **Properties** panel displays settings of this element.

To create a new series, click the plus ![](../../../images/eurd-web-report-explorer-add-style.png) button for the **Series** collection and select a required series type in the invoked window.

To delete an element, select it and click the **Remove**  ![](../../../images/eurd-web-fieldlist-data-source-delete.png).

This part also provides the following buttons:

| Icon | Description |
|---|---|
|![](../../../images/eurd-web-designer-main-toolbar-undo.png)| Reverses the most recent action. |
|![](../../../images/eurd-web-designer-main-toolbar-redo.png)| Performs the action you have previously undone. |

##Chart Properties

The **Properties** panel allows you to view and change settings of a chart and its elements. Changing any property updates the chart layout to display the current state.

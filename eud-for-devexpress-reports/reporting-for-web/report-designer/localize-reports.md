# Localize Reports

The Report Designer enables you to localize a report for different languages and cultures and save localized values to the report file.

## Use Properties Panel

Perform the following actions to localize a report:

1. Specify a report language other than _Default_:

    The **Language** drop-down list contains all available locales. The report's languages are highlighted in bold.

2. Change the controls' property values. You can move and resize a control.

3. Save the report.

When you load a localized report, use the **Language** drop-down list to switch to the localized version.

## Use Localization Editor

The [Localization Editor param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  allows you to change text strings in the report and expedite the translation process.

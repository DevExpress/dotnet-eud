# Configure Queries

Use this wizard page to configure queries to database collections of a MongoDB instance.

![Configure queries to a MongoDB instance](../../../images/data-source-wizard-configure-queries.png)

Specify the name of the database and database collection in the **Database** and **Collection** columns. You can use the **Filter** column to specify filter conditions for items of the database collections.

The names of queries to database collections should be unique. A string stored in a query's **Collection** column is the default name for this query. To create several queries to the same database collection, use the **Alias** column to specify different names for these queries.

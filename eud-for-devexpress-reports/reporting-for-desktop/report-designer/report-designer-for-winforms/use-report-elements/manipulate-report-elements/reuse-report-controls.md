# Reuse Report Controls

You can add selected controls to the [Report Gallery param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  and reuse them later in other reports. Select one or multiple controls while holding down the SHIFT or CTRL key and choose **Add To Gallery** in the context menu.

To add a selected template to a report, drag it from the Report Gallery onto a report's surface.

A template stores various settings related to its controls, such as binding information and appearance options. All these settings are restored after you add controls to a report.

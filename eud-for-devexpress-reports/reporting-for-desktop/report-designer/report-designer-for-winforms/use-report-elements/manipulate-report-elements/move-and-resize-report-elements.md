# Move and Resize Report Elements

You can use the mouse or keyboard to move a report control to a new location.

You can [select multiple controls param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  and move them in the same way as individual report controls.

You can also use the [Report Explorer param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  to move a control. You can move controls to other bands (except the **DetailReport** band), or into a **Panel** or **TableCell** controls. Select a control and drag it (either within the Report Explorer or to the design surface). The drop targets are highlighted when you drag the control over them.

> [!NOTE]
> You can drag the TableOfContents control only to the **ReportHeader** and **ReportFooter** bands.

To resize a control, select it and then drag a rectangle drawn on its edge or corner.

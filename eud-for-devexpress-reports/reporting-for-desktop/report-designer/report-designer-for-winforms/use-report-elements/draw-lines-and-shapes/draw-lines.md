# Draw Lines

The **Line** control draws a line in a specified direction, style, width, and color. You can use it to decorate and visually separate a report's sections.

To add a line to a report, drag the **Line** item from the [Toolbox param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  onto the report's area.

The actions list of the line's smart tag provides the main control properties:

* **Line Width**
	
	Specifies the line width in pixels as a floating point value.

* **Anchor Vertically**
	
	Specifies the vertical anchoring style, so that after page rendering a control stays attached to the top control, bottom control, or both.

> The **Line** control cannot span several bands. See [Draw Cross-Band Lines and Boxes param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }  to learn about drawing lines through several bands.

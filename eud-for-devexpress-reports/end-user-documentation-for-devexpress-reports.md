# End-User Documentation for DevExpress Reports

DevExpress Reporting ships end-user documentation that explains how to use the UI of reporting controls on each supported platform. It helps users solve common tasks and understand the interface elements available in Report Designers and Print Preview.

This documentation describes the basic principles of creating reports with the built-in Report Designer tools.

The Report Designer UI varies depending on the target platform.

The following topics are available in this section:

* [Reporting for Web param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value } 
* [Reporting for Desktop param($match) $path = $match.Groups[1].Value; if ($path -notmatch '^https?://' -and $path -notmatch '^~/' -and $path -notmatch '^\.\./\.\./') { '](' + '../' + $path + '.md)' } else { $match.Value }

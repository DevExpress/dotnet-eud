# End-User Documentation for BI Dashboard

DevExpress Dashboards ships end-user documentation that explains how to use dashboard UI elements across supported platforms. It helps users understand the interface, configure visualizations, and solve the most common tasks when working with dashboards.

This documentation describes the basic principles of creating, editing, and configuring dashboards with Dashboard Designers and Viewers.

The Dashboard Designer UI varies depending on the target platform.

The following topics are available in this section:

* [Dashboards for Web](dashboard-for-web/index.md)

* [Dashboards for Desktop](dashboard-for-desktop/index.md)

If you are looking for developer-oriented documentation with API reference, refer to [Business Intelligence Dashboard](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/12049/dashboard).

## Custom-Branded End-User Documentation

The documentation source is available in the GitHub repository: [github.com/DevExpress/dotnet-eud](https://github.com/DevExpress/dotnet-eud).

# Data Presentation Basics
The **Chart** dashboard item presents data visually using different types of series.

A series represents a grouping of related data points. The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a particular visual representation of data.

The Chart dashboard item includes the following series types.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_Bar_Icon](../../../images/img18730.png) A **Bar** series displays data as sets of rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_Line_Icon](../../../images/img18746.png) **Point** and **Line** series display data as standalone points or points joined by a line.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_Area_Icon](../../../images/img18728.png) An **Area** series displays data by a line that joins points, and the shaded area between the line and the argument axis.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_RangeArea_Icon](../../../images/img18748.png) A **Range** series is the area between two simple series displayed as a shaded area, or bars that stretch from a point in one series to the corresponding point in another series.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_Bubble_Icon](../../../images/img18732.png) A **Weighted** series displays data using a third dimension, expressed by a bubble's size.
* ![Charts_SeriesTypes_HighLowClose_Icon](../../../images/img18744.png) **Financial** series are useful in analyzing stock and bond prices, as well as the behavior of commodities.

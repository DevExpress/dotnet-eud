# Interactivity
This topic describes features that enable interaction between the **Treemap** and other dashboard items. These features include **Master Filtering**.

## Master Filtering
The Web Dashboard allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../data-presentation/master-filtering.md) topic.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a tile/group caption (or multiple tiles/group captions) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected tile(s).

To reset filtering, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_ClearSelection](../../../images/img19686.png) icon) in the Treemap's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area, or the **Clear Master Filter** command in the Treemap's context menu.

## Drill-Down
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more about drill-down concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Drill-Down](../../data-presentation/drill-down.md) topic.

When drill-down is enabled, you can click a tile to view the details.

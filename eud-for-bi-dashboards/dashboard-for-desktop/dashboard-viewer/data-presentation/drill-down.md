# Drill-Down
Dashboard provides the **drill-down** feature, which allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in a dashboard item. This feature allows you to drill down to display the details, or drill up to view more general information.

To learn how to drill down using a particular dashboard item, refer to the documentation for this item in the [Dashboard Items](../dashboard-items.md) topic.

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![DrillDown_DrillUpArrow](../../images/img18627.png) icon) in the dashboard item's [caption](dashboard-layout.md), or the corresponding command in the context menu.

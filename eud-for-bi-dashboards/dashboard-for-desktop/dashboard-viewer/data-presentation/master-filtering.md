# Master Filtering
The **Dashboard** allows you to use any data-aware dashboard item as a filter for the entire dashboard (**Master Filter**). You can select elements in a **Master Filter** item (chart bars, pie segments, grid records, etc.) to filter data in the rest of the dashboard by the selected values.

## Master Filtering Modes
The Master Filter item supports two selection modes.
* **Multiple**
	
	Allows you to select multiple elements in the Master Filter item.
	
	To clear the selection in the Master Filter item, use the **Clear Master Filter** button in the dashboard item's [caption](dashboard-layout.md).

* **Single**
	
	Allows you to select only one element in the Master Filter item. When this mode is enabled, the default selection will be set to a Master Filter element. You can change this selection, but cannot clear it.

To learn how to filter dashboard data via a specific dashboard item, refer to the documentation for this item in the [Dashboard Items](../dashboard-items.md) section.

# Sorting
The Web Dashboard allows you to easily change the sort order of values within a dashboard item. You can also enable sorting by measure values.

## Changing Sort Order
To change the sort order of dimension values displayed within a dashboard item, open the dashboard item **Bindings** menu, select a data item and go to the **Data Shaping** section. Here you can select the _Ascending_ or _Descending_ sort order.

## Sorting by Measure Values
The Web Dashboard also allows you to sort dimension values by summary values calculated for a specific measure. To do this, in the drop-down **Sort Measure** list, select a measure by which you want to sort this data item.

# Preview Data
The [Dashboard Data Source Wizard](dashboard-data-source-wizard.md) and [Query Builder](query-builder.md) allow you to preview data returned after a query or [stored procedure](../../provide-data/working-with-sql-data-sources/stored-procedures.md) execution. To do this, click the **Preview...** button.

This invokes the **Data Preview** window containing data returned after you execute the current query.

# Drill-Down
The Web Dashboard provides the **drill-down** feature, which allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in a dashboard item. This feature allows you to drill down to display the details, or drill up to view more general information.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot drill down to view the details if **Multi-Select** is enabled in [Multiple Master Filter](master-filtering.md) mode.

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![WebViewer_DrillUpIcon](images/img22464.png) icon) in the dashboard item's [caption](dashboard-layout.md) area.

To learn how to drill down using a particular dashboard item, refer to the documentation for this item in the [Dashboard Items](../dashboard-items.md) topic.

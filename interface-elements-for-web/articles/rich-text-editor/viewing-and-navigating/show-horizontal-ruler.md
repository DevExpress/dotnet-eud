The horizontal ruler is used to align text, graphics and other elements in a document. It also controls the width of table columns and the horizontal spacing of paragraph margins, columns and tabs.

By default, the horizontal ruler is shown on the **Text Editing Surface**. To hide the ruler, select the **View** tab and click the **Horizontal Ruler** button in the **Show** group.

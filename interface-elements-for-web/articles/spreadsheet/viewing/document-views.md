 The **Editing View** mode enables all features to modify a document. 

 The **Reading View** mode disables the editing functionality and replaces the [ribbon](../spreadsheet-ui/ribbon-interface.md) with a compact toolbar that is rendered more quickly. This mode is optimized specifically for reading documents.

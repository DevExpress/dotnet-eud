# Document Views
Use ribbon buttons contained in the **View** tab in the **Document Views** group to switch document views.

 The **Editing View** mode enables all the spreadsheet's features to modify documents. 

 The **Reading View** mode disables the editing functionality, and replaces the [ribbon](../spreadsheet-ui/ribbon-interface.md) with a compact toolbar that is rendered more quickly than the ribbon. This mode is optimized specifically for reading documents.

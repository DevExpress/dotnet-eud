# Comments
The **Spreadsheet** allows you to attach notes to individual cells by using **comments**. Comments are extremely useful when you need to provide additional information, such as reminders, notifications, or feedback in a document without modifying cell content.

Comments are stored separately from a cell and displayed in a floating text box. A cell containing a comment has a red triangular indicator in the corner.

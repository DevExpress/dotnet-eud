# Insert and Delete Columns and Rows 
The **Spreadsheet** provides the capability to insert and delete columns and rows in a worksheet.

## Insert Columns
1. To insert a single column, [select](../editing-cells/select-cells-or-cell-content.md) the entire column by clicking the column heading, or by clicking a cell in the column to the left of where the new column will be inserted. To insert multiple columns, [select](../editing-cells/select-cells-or-cell-content.md) the number of columns you wish to insert. For example, to insert three columns, select three columns by clicking column headings.
2. In the **Cells** group within the **Home** tab, click the **Insert** button and select the **Insert Sheet Columns** item from the drop-down list.

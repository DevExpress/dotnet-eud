# Build Complex Filter Criteria
To build complex filter criteria consisting of multiple filter clauses using various filter operators, you can use a Prefilter (Filter Editor).

The Prefilter does not affect filtering via Filter Windows.

To invoke a Prefilter, click an empty space within the Pivot Table header region and select **Show Prefilter** from the context menu.

After you have built and applied a filter condition, a filter panel appears at the Pivot Table bottom. This panel displays the filter condition.

To modify a filter condition, open a Prefilter. You can now do it by clicking a filter condition displayed in the filter panel.

To temporarily disable filtering, uncheck the ![EU_PrefilterCheckBox](../../../../images/img15876.png) button.

To remove filtering, click **Clear**.

For information on the Prefilter filtering capabilities, see [Filter Editor](../../../filter-editor.md).

# Filter Data in Pivot Tables
By default, the Pivot Table processes all records when calculating its values. Data filtering allows you to process only those records that meet your requirements.

Topics in this section describe two ways of filtering data in Pivot Tables - using Filter Windows (provide simple filtering capabilities) and the Prefilter (used for advanced filtering).

The following sections and topics are available:
* [Filter Data by Field Values](filter-data/filter-data-by-field-values.md)
	
	This section contains topics that describe how to specify simple filter conditions via Filter Windows.
* [Build Complex Filter Criteria](filter-data/build-complex-filter-criteria.md)
	
	This topic describes the Prefilter feature that allows you to build complex filter criteria.

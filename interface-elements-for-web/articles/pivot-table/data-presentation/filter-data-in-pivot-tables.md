# Filter Data in Pivot Tables
By default, the Pivot Table processes all records when calculating its values. Data filtering allows you to process only those records that meet your requirements.

This section explains how to use Filter Windows (for simple filtering) and the Filter Editor (for advanced filtering) to filter Pivot Table data.

The following sections and topics are available:
* [Filter Data by Field Values](filter-data/filter-data-by-field-values.md)
	
	This section contains topics that describe how to specify simple filter conditions via Filter Windows.
* [Build Complex Filter Criteria](filter-data/build-complex-filter-criteria.md)
	
	This topic describes the Filter Editor feature that allows you to build complex filter criteria.

# Responsive Layout

The menu can operate in the following ways when the browser window's width changes:
* The menu automatically resizes or hides its items in the popup menu hidden under the ellipse button. Click the ellipsis button to show the hidden items.

* The horizontal menu items automatically transform into a vertical side-menu when the hamburger button is clicked.

**Remarks**

A filter condition group is a set of conditions combined by the same logical operator. The following filter expression contains two groups combined by the logical **OR** operator: "(Country Equals 'UK' And Category Equals 'Beverages') Or (Country Equals 'USA' And Category Equals 'Produce')". In the **Filter Control**, it is represented as follows.

# Creating Complex Filter Criteria with the Filter Control
To build complex filter criteria with an unlimited number of filter conditions, combined by logical operators, use the built-in **Filter Control**.

Use the ![FilterEditor_EU_AddButton](../../../images/img7350.png) and ![FilterEditor_EU_DeleteButton](../../../images/img7351.png) buttons embedded into the control to create and customize the filter criteria:

**Remarks**

A filter condition group is a set of conditions combined by a logical operator. The following filter expression contains two groups combined by the logical **OR** operator: "(Country Equals 'UK' And Category Equals 'Beverages') Or (Country Equals 'USA' And Category Equals 'Produce')".

# Keyboard Navigation
You can use a keyboard to perform Tree List primary navigation operations.

## Access Key
Press CTRL+SHIFT+[_AccessKey_] keys to navigate to the Tree List.

## Focused Node
Press the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to move focus between nodes. Moving focus from the ultimate (first or last) node within a page changes the page within the Tree List, if possible.

## Node Selection
Press the SPACE key to select and cancel the selection of the focused node. To select multiple nodes, move node focus by arrow keys while holding down the SHIFT key.

## Expanding/Collapsing Nodes
Press the PLUS/RIGHT ARROW and MINUS/LEFT ARROW keys to expand and collapse nodes.

## Paging
 Press the SHIFT+PAGE UP and SHIFT+PAGE DOWN key combinations to go to the next and previous Tree List page.

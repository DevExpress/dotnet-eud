# Keyboard Navigation
Grid primary navigation operations can be performed using a keyboard as an alternative to a pointing device.

## Access Key
You can navigate to the grid by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+[_AccessKey_] keys.

## Focused Row
Press the UP ARROW and DOWN ARROW keys to move focus between rows. Moving focus from the ultimate (first or last) row within a page changes the page within the grid, if possible.

## Row Selection
 Press the SPACE key to select and cancel the selection of the focused row. Multiple rows can be selected, by moving row focus using the arrow keys while holding down the SHIFT key.

## Expanding/Collapsing Rows
Press the PLUS and MINUS keys to expand and collapse group and detail rows. Row collapsing and expanding can be performed using the LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW keys.

## Paging
 Press the SHIFT+PAGE UP and SHIFT+PAGE DOWN key combinations to go to the next and previous grid page.

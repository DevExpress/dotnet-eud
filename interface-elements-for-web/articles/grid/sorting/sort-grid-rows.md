# Sorting
* Click a column header to sort data in ascending order. If sorting has already been applied, subsequent clicks reverse the current sort order.

* A click on a column header clears the sort settings on any other columns. Hold the SHIFT key down while clicking to sort against multiple columns.
* Click a column's header while pressing the CTRL key to clear the column's sorting.

You can use the [customization dialog](../customization-dialog/sorting-page.md) to sort grid data, change the sorting order (ascending/descending), and change the order of sorted columns within the grid.

# Sorting Page
The **Sorting** page enables you to sort grid data, change the sorting order, and change the order of sorted columns within the grid.

Select a column's check box in the **Columns to Sort** list, to sort grid data against this column in ascending order. The grid can be sorted more than by one column; a list of the sorted columns is displayed at the top of the **Sorting** page.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-drag](../../../images/img128887.png) to drag the columns in this list and change the sorting priority.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-order](../../../images/img128888.png) to reverse a column's current sort order.
* Use ![eud-grid-customizationdialog-sorting-delete](../../../images/img128889.png) or clear a column's check box in the **Columns to Sort** list, to remove a column from the sorting list.

A grouping column is always sorted, therefore its remove button is displayed disabled. You can see the list of grouping columns in the [Grouping](grouping-page.md) dialog page.

Click the **Apply** (![eud-grid-customizationdialog-apply-button](../../../images/grid-customizationdialog-apply.png)) or **Close** (![eud-grid-customizationdialog-close-button](../../../images/grid-customizationdialog-close.png)) button to apply or discard the changes, respectively.

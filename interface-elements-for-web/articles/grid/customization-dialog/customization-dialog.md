The following pages are available within the dialog:
* [Sorting](sorting-page.md) page enables you to sort grid data, change the sorting order (ascending/descending), and change the order of sorted columns within the grid.
* [Grouping](grouping-page.md) page enables you to group grid data and change the order of grouped columns within the grid.
* [Filtering](filtering-page.md) page enables you to filter grid data by entering filter criteria.
* [Column Chooser](column-chooser.md) page enables you to change the order and visibility of data columns.

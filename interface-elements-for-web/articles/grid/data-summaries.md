# Data Summaries

The grid can calculate and displays summaries, i.e., brief information about groups of rows or individual data columns. The following most popular aggregate functions are provided.
* Average

The grid supports two types of summaries: total and group summary.

## Total Summary
A total summary calculates the value of an aggregate function over all the rows within a grid and is displayed within the footer.

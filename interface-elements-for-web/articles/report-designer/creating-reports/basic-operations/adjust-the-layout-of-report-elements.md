---
This document describes how to customize the layout of a [report element](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/report-elements.md) after it is [created](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/creating-reports/basic-operations/create-report-elements.md). To move and resize an element or align it within the current report, perform one the following actions.
* [Select Report Elements](#select)
* [Move and Resize Report Elements](#move)
* [Align and Position Report Elements](#align)

## <a name="select"/>Select Report Elements
To select a [report control](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/report-elements/report-controls.md) or a [band](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/report-elements/report-bands.md), click it.
 

For multiple controls selection, click report controls while holding the **CTRL** key down.

Alternatively, click on a blank space and drag the mouse to create a selection frame. When the mouse button is released, all controls within the selection frame's boundaries will be selected. In this case, the previous selection is cleared.

## <a name="align"/>Align and Position Report Elements

To align the selected control or multiple selected controls, switch to the [Properties Panel](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/properties-panel.md), expand the **Actions** category, and click an appropriate button.

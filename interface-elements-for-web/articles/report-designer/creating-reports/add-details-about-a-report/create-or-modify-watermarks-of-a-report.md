title: Create or Modify Watermarks of a Report
---
This topic describes how to add a text watermark in a report or turn a picture into a report's background. Note that watermarks are visible only in the [Preview](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/document-preview.md) mode.

To create a new watermark in a report (or to modify the existing one), do the following.
1. In the [Properties Panel](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/interface-elements/properties-panel.md), expand the Report Controls drop-down list and select the report.
2. In the **Appearance** category, expand the **Watermark** section. To adjust text watermark settings, specify the watermark's text as well as direction, transparency, and the color of this text.

3. For a picture watermark, you need to specify an image. To do this, click the ellipsis button for the **Image** property. In the invoked dialog, select the file containing the image that you wish to use as a watermark and click Open. Next, define the picture's properties, such as **Transparency**, **Tiling**, **Alignment** and **View Mode**.

	For both types of watermarks, you can also adjust a watermark position behind the document content by enabling the **Show Behind** flag, and specify the page range in which the watermark will be printed.
	
	Additionally, it is possible to use both textual and image watermarks simultaneously.

The report with watermark is now ready. Switch your report to the [Preview](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/report-designer/document-preview.md) mode and view the result.

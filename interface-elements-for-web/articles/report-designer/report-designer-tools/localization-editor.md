# Localization Editor

The Localization Editor allows you to change the text of the localizable textual properties for all the controls in a report.

The top panel allows you to change the report's language, add a new language to start localization or delete a language.

The main panel contains a grid that displays the text in the default language and the corresponding text in the selected language.  Each row represents the **Text** property of a report element. When you click a grid row, the Designer view navigates to the report element on the Report Designer surface and highlights the element

The text strings for the selected language are editable. When a user finishes editing text, the Report Designer displays the updated text.

## Invoke the Editor

Click **Localization** in the Report Designer menu:

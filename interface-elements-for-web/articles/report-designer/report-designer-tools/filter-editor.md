# Filter Editor

This document describes the Filter Editor available in the [End-User Report Designer](../../report-designer.md).

## Filter Editor Overview

The **Filter Editor** provides a visual interface for constructing filter criteria of varying complexity with an unlimited number of filter conditions combined by logical operators.

A filter condition consists of three parts:

* A field of a data source to which a report is bound.
* Criteria operator, such as **Equals**, **Is less than**, **Is between**, etc.
* A static operand value, another data field or a report parameter.

You can arrange specific conditions into groups with **And**, **Or**, **No And** , and **Not Or** operators.

## Invoking the Filter Editor
You can invoke the Filter Editor in one of the following ways:

* In the [Properties](ui-panels/properties-panel.md) panel, click the ellipsis button for the report's **Filter String** property to filter data at the report level.

* In the [Query Builder](query-builder.md), click the ellipsis button for the **Filter** or **Group Filter** property to filter data at the data source level.

## Tree-Like Filtering

The Filter Editor displays filter criteria as a tree where individual nodes specify simple filter conditions. The root node is the logical operator combining all the conditions.

Click the plus button next to the operator to add a new condition or group.

You can select the required data field and comparison operator from the corresponding drop-down lists and enter an operand value in the dedicated value box.

Expand the drop-down menu for a value placeholder and select **Property** or **Parameter** to compare a data field with another data field or a report parameter. Then, click the converted placeholder and select the required item.

You can change the logical operator by clicking it and selecting the desired type.

Click the filter condition's ![](../../../images/eurd-web-filter-editor-remove-button.png) button to delete it.

## Text-Based Filtering

In the advanced mode, the Filter Editor allows you to type a filter string manually.

Refer to the [Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions](../use-expressions/expression-syntax.md) topic for the list of available operators and functions and for details on their usage.

This editor supports intelligent code completion (suggesting functions and available data columns as you type).

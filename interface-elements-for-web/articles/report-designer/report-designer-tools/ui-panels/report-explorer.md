## Manage Report Elements

Report Explorer displays all [report controls](../../use-report-elements.md) and [bands](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) in a tree-like form.

The following actions are available to customize report elements:

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-fieldlist-data-source-edit-relationships.png) | Switches to the [Properties Panel](properties-panel.md) where you can adjust the selected report element's or the entire report's settings. |
| ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-fieldlist-data-source-delete.png) | Deletes the selected report element. Note that this button is not available for the **Detail**, **Top Margin**, and **Bottom Margin** bands. |

You can use drag-and-drop for the following operations:

* Reorder report controls, or move them from one band to another.

An acceptable drop target is highlighted in green when you drag an item over it. An unacceptable target is highlighted in red.

## Manage Report Styles

Expand the **Styles** category in Report Explorer to access the [report style](../../customize-appearance/report-visual-styles.md) collection.

To apply a style to a report control, drag a style item from Report Explorer onto this control.

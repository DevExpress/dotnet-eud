# Report Wizard

The Report Wizard allows you to add a report using one of the following templates:

* [Empty Report](report-wizard\empty-report.md)
	
	Creates a new blank report that is not bound to a data source.
* [Data-bound Report](report-wizard\data-bound-report.md)
	
	Allows you to connect the created report to a data source and configure basic report layout settings (optional).
* [Label Report](report-wizard\label-report.md)
	
	Allows you to select from different customizable layouts to create labels, badges or price tags.

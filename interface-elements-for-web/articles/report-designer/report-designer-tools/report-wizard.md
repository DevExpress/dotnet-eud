## Select the Report Type

On the start page, choose the report type you want to create.

* [Empty Report](report-wizard\empty-report.md)

    Creates a blank report that is not bound to a data source. Choose this option to design your report from scratch without the wizard.

* [Table Report](report-wizard\table-and-vertical-report.md)

    Creates a [table report](../create-popular-reports/create-a-table-report.md) and binds it to data.

* [Vertical Report](report-wizard\table-and-vertical-report.md)

    Creates a [vertical report](../create-popular-reports/create-a-vertical-report.md) and binds it to data.

* [Label Report](report-wizard\label-report.md)

    Creates badges, business cards, price tags and other label types.

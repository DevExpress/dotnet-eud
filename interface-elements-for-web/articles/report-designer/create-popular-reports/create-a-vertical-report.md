# Create a Vertical Report

This tutorial describes how to use vertical bands to create a report where record fields are arranged vertically and data records are printed horizontally.

The wizard adds report controls to the following [bands](../../report-designer/introduction-to-banded-reports.md):

- **Vertical Header band**  
    Contains a table with a single column that displays data field headers.
- **Vertical Details band**  
    Contains a table with a single column that is printed as many times as there are records in the report's data source.
- **Vertical Total band**  
    Contains a table with a single column that has as many labels in cells as there are summary functions you specified for each field in the Report Wizard.

Switch to the Preview mode to see the result.

> [!Tip]
> You can create a vertical report without using the Report Wizard. Click **Insert Vertical Header Band** in the report's Actions group.

## Set Vertical Table Options

You can set the following options to modify the vertical table:

* Set the Vertical Header band's **Repeat Every Page** property to false to display field headers once - on the first report page.

* Set the Vertical Detail band's **Band Layout** property to **Across Then Down** to print the data records that do not fit a page on the same page, otherwise, they are printed on the next page.

* Add a field to the **Sort Fields** group to sort the report's data.

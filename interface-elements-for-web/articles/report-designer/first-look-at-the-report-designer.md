# First Look at the Report Designer

![](../../images/eurd-web-report-bands-default-design-time.png)

The [Design Surface](report-designer-tools\design-surface.md) displays a report's structure and contents. You can use the tools on the Report Designer's panels to design the report:

- use the [Menu](report-designer-tools\menu.md) to manage and set up reports;

- drop report controls from the [Toolbox](report-designer-tools\toolbox.md) to the design surface;

- access report editing commands in the [Main Toolbar](report-designer-tools\toolbar.md);

- use the [Properties](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\properties-panel.md) panel to set up the report controls;

- use the [Expressions](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\expressions-panel.md) panel to provide data to the report controls and conditionally shape data;

- access the report's data source schema in the [Field List](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\field-list.md) panel;

- access the report's elements in the [Report Explorer](report-designer-tools\ui-panels\report-explorer.md) panel.

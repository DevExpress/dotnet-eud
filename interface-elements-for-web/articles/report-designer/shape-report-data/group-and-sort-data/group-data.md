# Group Data

## <a name="overview"></a>Group a Report's Data
Do the following to group data in your report:

1. Create a new or open an existing data-bound report.
	
	You cannot apply grouping unless your report is bound to a data source.
2. Insert the [Group Header](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band,      select the **Group Fields** section in the **Actions** category and add a      new group field to group the report's data by the required data field.

	> [!Note]
	> See the [Group Data by a Custom Field](group-data-by-a-custom-field.md) tutorial to learn how to group a report's data by a custom field.

3. Click the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-ascending.png) or 
![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-descending.png) buttons to define the      sort order within the group (ascending or descending). 
    
    Use the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-disable-sorting.png) button if your groups are already ordered in the data source, and you do not need to sort them in the report.

2. Click the plus button for the **Group Fields** section to create a new group field and specify its **Field Name** property.    
    
    Use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to specify the order in which these criteria are applied to the report's data.

	The following images illustrate how a report looks when it is grouped by multiple criteria:
	
	| A single group with multiple group fields | Nested group header bands |
	|---|---|
	| ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-multiple-fields-example.png) | ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-nested-fields-example.png) |

6. Drag the corresponding field from the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) panel and drop it onto the group header to display the group field's value in the report.

The resulting report looks as follows:

## <a name="options"></a>Specify the Group's Settings
Expand the **Group Fields** section to customize the group's layout settings:

* Use the **Group Union** property to keep a group's content on the same page when possible.
	
	![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-group-union-property.png)

* Use the **Keep Together** property to print the Group Header/Footer on the same page as the group's contents.
	
	![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-keep-together-property.png)

* Use the **Repeat Every Page** property to print the group band on each page.
	
	![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-repeat-every-page-property.png)

* Use the **Page Break** property to start a new page before or after each group.
	
	![](../../../../images/eurd-web-group-data-page-break-property.png)

When you need to display page numbers for individual groups, add the [Page Info](../../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/page-info.md) control to the Group Header or Footer and set its **Running Band** property to the Group Header's name.

Accurate page numbering requires that different groups do not appear on the same page. For this reason, you need to set the Group Footer's **Page Break** property to **After Band**, or place the **Page Break** control at the band's bottom.

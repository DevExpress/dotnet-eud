# Sort Data

## <a name="sort"></a>Sort a Report's Data
Do the followebg to sort data in your report:

1. Create a new or open an existing data-bound report.
	
	You cannot apply sorting unless your report is bound to a data source.
2. Switch to the [Properties](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/properties-panel.md) panel and select the [Detail](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band. Select the **Sort Fields** section in the **Actions** category and add a new sort field to sort the report's data by the required data field.

	> [!Note]
	> See the [Sort Data by a Custom Field](sort-data-by-a-custom-field.md) tutorial to learn how to sort a report's data by a custom field.
	
	This adds a corresponding sort field to the **Sort Fields** collection. You can access this collection by expanding the sort field section.
		

3. Click the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-ascending.png) or ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-order-descending.png) buttons to define the sort order within the group (ascending or descending). Use the ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-disable-sorting.png) button to disable sorting in grouped data.

4. When a report has multiple sort fields, you can change their order by clicking **Move Up** or **Move Down**.

6. Drag the corresponding field from the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) onto the report area and switch to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md) to see the result.

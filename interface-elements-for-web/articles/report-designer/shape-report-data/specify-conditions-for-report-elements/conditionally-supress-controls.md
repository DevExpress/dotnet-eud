# Conditionally Suppress Controls

This document describes how to display or hide a report control in a published document based on a specified logical condition.

> [!Warning]
> Use the approach below if expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer (the Designer provides the [Expressions](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel).
>
> See [Conditionally Suppress Controls](../shape-data-data-bindings/conditionally-supress-controls.md) if expression bindings **are not enabled** in the Report Designer (the Designer does not provide the [Expressions](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel).

1. [Create a new report](../../add-new-reports.md) or open an existing one and prepare the report layout.

2. Select the required control, switch to the [Expressions](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel and click the **Visible** property's ellipsis button.

3. In the invoked [Expression Editor](../../report-designer-tools/expression-editor.md), specify the required [expression](../../use-expressions.md).

	Use the **Iif** function to define the required condition. For example:
	
	**Iif([Discontinued] == False, False, [Discontinued])**
	
	This expression means that if the data field's value is **False**, the control's **Visible** property's value is also **False**.

When switching to [Print Preview](../../preview-print-and-export-reports.md), you can view the report control's visibility changes according to the assigned condition.

# Calculate a Summary

This document describes how to calculate various summaries across a report and its groups.

> [!Warning]
> Use the approach below if expression bindings **are enabled** in the Report Designer (the Designer provides the [Expressions](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel).
>
> See [Calculate a Summary](../shape-data-data-bindings/calculate-a-summary.md) if expression bindings **are not enabled** in the Report Designer (the Designer does not provide the [Expressions](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel).

1. [Create a new report](../../add-new-reports.md) or open an existing one and [bind it to a data source](../../bind-to-data.md).

2. Insert the [Group Header](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) band, select the **Group Fields** section in the **Actions** category and add a new group field to group the report's data by the required field.

3. Insert the Group Footer band. Prepare the report layout and drop a required data field onto the group footer to display the summary result.

4. Select the label, expand the **Summary** section and invoke the **Running** drop-down list. Select the range for which to calculate a summary (the entire report, a specific report group or document page).

5. Click the **Expression** property's ellipsis button.

6. This invokes the [Expression Editor](../../report-designer-tools/expression-editor.md) where you can select the required summary in the **Functions** | **Summary** section. Report summary functions start with the "sum" prefix to make it easy to differentiate them from aggregate functions.

	> [!TIP]
	> See the [Expression Constants, Operators, and Functions](../../use-expressions/expression-syntax.md) topic for a complete list of supported summary functions.

7. You can use the **Text Format String** property to format the summary's value.

# Reports with Embedded PDF Content

This tutorial explains how to use the [PDF Content](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/pdf-content.md) control to do the following:

* Append PDF file pages to a report and make their paper kind the same as in the inital report.
* Add sequential page numbers to the report and PDF file pages.
* Include additional information in the embedded PDF file pages.

The image below shows an invoice report that contains information about order items.

The following image illustrates the first PDF file page embedded to the invoice report. This page has the same paper kind as the initial report. [Report controls](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls.md) are used to add item title, item price, line, logo image, and sequential page numbers to this page.

To create the above report with PDF content, follow the steps described in these sections:

* [Create the Main Report](#create-the-main-report)
* [Create a Report with PDF Content](#create-a-report-with-pdf-content)
* [Add the Report with PDF content to the Main Report](#add-the-report-with-pdf-content-to-the-main-report)

## Create the Main Report

1. Open the [Report Designer](../first-look-at-the-report-designer.md) and [add a new blank report](../add-new-reports.md).
2. Design the report layout. In this tutorial, we create an invoice report that contains information about order items.

    ![Main Report Layout](../../../images/eurd-web-pdfcontent-embedded-mode-main-report-layout.png)

    To supply the report with data, use the following JSON string:

    ```
    {
        "InvoiceNumber": 241756,
        "OrderDate": "2018-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
        "Customer": {
            "Name": "Walters",
            "HomeOffice_Line": "200 Wilmot Rd",
            "HomeOffice_City": "Deerfield",
            "HomeOffice_StateName": "IL",
            "HomeOffice_ZipCode": "60015"
        },
        "Store": {
            "Address_City": "Anaheim",
            "Address_Line": "1720 W La Palma Ave",
            "Address_StateName": "CA",
            "Address_ZipCode": "83709"
        },
        "Employee": {
            "FullName": "Harv Mudd"
        },
        "PONumber": "122023",
        "ShipMethod": 0,
        "OrderTerms": "15 Days",
        "OrderItems": [
            {
                "ProductName": "SuperLED 42",
                "ProductPrice": 1050,
                "ProductUnits": 2,
                "Discount": 50,
                "Total": 2050
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "SuperLED 50",
                "ProductPrice": 1100,
                "ProductUnits": 5,
                "Discount": 500,
                "Total": 5000
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "Projector PlusHD",
                "ProductPrice": 600,
                "ProductUnits": 5,
                "Discount": 250,
                "Total": 2750
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "HD Video Player",
                "ProductPrice": 220,
                "ProductUnits": 10,
                "Discount": 200,
                "Total": 2000
            }
        ],
        "ShippingAmount": 375,
        "TotalAmount": 12175
    }
    ```

The following image illustrates the main report's **Preview**:

## Create a Report with PDF Content

1. Create a new blank report. Remove the report's margins.

    ![Add a New Blank Report and Remove Margins](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-add-new-blank-report-and-remove-margins.png)

2. Drop the [PDF Content](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/pdf-content.md) control from the **Toolbox** onto the *Detail* band.

    ![Drop the PDF Content Control Onto the Detail Band](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-drop-xrpdfcontent-control-onto-detail-band.png)

3. Select the control, navigate to the [Properties panel](../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/properties-panel.md), click **Source** or **Source URL** property's ellipsis button, and select PDF file. In this demo, we use the following PDF specification: [Specification.pdf](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/DataSources/blob/master/Specification.pdf).

    ![Specify PDF File Source](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-specify-pdf-file-source.png)

4. Disable the control's **Generate Own Pages** property. Adjust the control size to make PDF content fit the entire *Detail* band. For this, set the *Detail* band's **Height** to *1095* and the control's **Width** and **Height** to *849* and *1095*.

    ![Make PDF Content Fit the Entire Detail Band](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-make-pdf-content-fit-entire-detail-band.png)

5. [Bind](../bind-to-data/bind-a-report-to-json-data.md) the report to the JSON data below and set the report's **Data Member** property to *OrderItems*.
    
    ```
    {
        "InvoiceNumber": 241756,
        "OrderDate": "2018-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
        "Customer": {
            "Name": "Walters",
            "HomeOffice_Line": "200 Wilmot Rd",
            "HomeOffice_City": "Deerfield",
            "HomeOffice_StateName": "IL",
            "HomeOffice_ZipCode": "60015"
        },
        "Store": {
            "Address_City": "Anaheim",
            "Address_Line": "1720 W La Palma Ave",
            "Address_StateName": "CA",
            "Address_ZipCode": "83709"
        },
        "Employee": {
            "FullName": "Harv Mudd"
        },
        "PONumber": "122023",
        "ShipMethod": 0,
        "OrderTerms": "15 Days",
        "OrderItems": [
            {
                "ProductName": "SuperLED 42",
                "ProductPrice": 1050,
                "ProductUnits": 2,
                "Discount": 50,
                "Total": 2050
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "SuperLED 50",
                "ProductPrice": 1100,
                "ProductUnits": 5,
                "Discount": 500,
                "Total": 5000
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "Projector PlusHD",
                "ProductPrice": 600,
                "ProductUnits": 5,
                "Discount": 250,
                "Total": 2750
            },
            {
                "ProductName": "HD Video Player",
                "ProductPrice": 220,
                "ProductUnits": 10,
                "Discount": 200,
                "Total": 2000
            }
        ],
        "ShippingAmount": 375,
        "TotalAmount": 12175
    }
    ```
    
6. Place two [labels](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/label.md), a [line](../use-report-elements/draw-lines-and-shapes/draw-lines.md), and a [picture box](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/picture-box.md) on the PDF page header as shown below:

    ![Add Controls to Page Header](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-make-pdf-content-add-controls-to-page-header.png)

    Use the following locations and sizes:

    | Control Name | Location | Size |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | label1 | 105, 94 | 280, 44 |
    | label2 | 105, 138 | 118, 30 |
    | line1 | 105, 69 | 687, 20 |
    | pictureBox1 | 647, 24 | 145, 45 |

7. Set the line's **Width** and **Fore Color** to *2* and orange (*rgb(255,165,0)*) respectively. Assign the following image to the picture box's **Image Source** property:

    ![DevAV Icon](../../../images/devav.png)

    Set the image's **Sizing** property to *Stretch Image*.

    Make the label1's font bold. Set up label appearance as shown in the table below:

    | Control Name | Font | Font Size | Text Property's Expression | Text Format String |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | label1 | Segoe UI | 21 | *ProductName* | - |
    | label2 | Segoe UI | 12 | *ProductPrice* | {0:$0} |

    ![Bind Labels to Data](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-make-pdf-content-bind-labels-to-data.png)

    To display a product name and price of each order item on a corresponding PDF file page, set the PDF Content **Page Range** property's [expression](../use-expressions.md) to *[DataSource.CurrentRowIndex] + 1*.

8. Add the [Page Info](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/page-info.md) control to the PDF page footer. Use the following settings for this control:

    | Location | Size | Font | Font Size | Text Alignment | Text Format String |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0, 1045 | 849, 50 | Segoe UI | 12 | Middle Center | Page {0} of {1} |

## Add the Report with PDF Content to the Main Report

1. Add a footer to the main report.

    ![Add Report Footer](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-add-report-footer.png)

2. Add the [Subreport](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/subreport.md) control to the footer. Assign the report with PDF content to the control's **Report Source URL** property. Enable the control's **Generate Own Pages** property.

    ![Add the Subreport](../../../images/eurd-web-create-report-with-pdf-content-add-subreport.png)

3. Add the [Page Info](../use-report-elements/use-basic-report-controls/page-info.md) control to the report's **Bottom Margin** band. Set the control's **Text Alignment** propery to *Middle Center* and the **Text Format String** property to *Page {0} of {1}*.

## <a name="addwatermark"></a>Add a Watermark to a Report
To add a watermark to a report, do the following.

1. Switch to the [Properties](..\report-designer-tools\ui-panels\properties-panel.md) panel and expand the **Watermark** node in the **Appearance** category.

	For a text watermark, specify the text, direction and font options.

	In the invoked dialog, select the file containing the image that you wish to use as a watermark and click **Open**. Next, specify the size mode and alignment options for the picture.
	
	Additionally, for both textual and picture watermarks, you can adjust the transparency, position (in front of or behind the document content), and the page range in which the watermark will be printed.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The **Transparency** property is unavailable when you specify an SVG image.

## <a name="preprintedform"></a>Supply a Preprinted Form
You can use a picture watermark as a template, to display an image of the preprinted form on the report's body at design time.

To display a watermark at design time, expand the **Design** category and enable the **Draw the Watermark** property.

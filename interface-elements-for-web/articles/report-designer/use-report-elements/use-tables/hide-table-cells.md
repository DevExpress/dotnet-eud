# Hide Table Cells

You can hide a specific table cell conditionally, for instance, based on a [report parameter](../../shape-report-data/use-report-parameters.md) value.

Select the **Parameters** node in the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) and click the **Add parameter** button.

Click the **Edit** button to expand the property list and specify the parameter's name and description for Print Preview, and set the type to **Boolean**.

Open the [Expressions](../../../report-designer/report-designer-tools/ui-panels/expressions-panel.md) panel and specify an [expression](../../shape-report-data/shape-data-expression-bindings/conditionally-supress-controls.md) for the cell's **Visible** property to define a logical condition for displaying or hiding this cell.

The image below demonstrates how to provide the visibility expression for the cell bound to the **CategoryID** field. For a report to display correctly, you should specify the same expression for the cell that displays the field caption in the Page Header.

The **Process Hidden Cell Mode** property allows you to define how to distribute the remaining space between the table's visible cells.

The image below illustrates how the original table looks like:

The following modes are available to process hidden cells:

* **StretchPreviousCell** - A cell to the left of the hidden cell is stretched to occupy the available space. If the hidden cell is the first in the row, the next cell is stretched.

* **StretchNextCell** - A cell to the right of the hidden cell is stretched to occupy the available space. If the hidden cell is the last in the row, the previous cell is stretched.

* **ResizeCellsEqually** - All visible cells are resized to divide the space that a hidden cell reserved equally.

* **ResizeCellsProportionally** - All visible cells are resized to proportionally divide the space that a hidden cell reserved based on their weights in the whole table width.

* **DecreaseTableWidth** - The table width is decreased, and visible cells are shifted to a hidden cell's location without changing their size.

* **LeaveEmptySpace** (the default mode) - A space remains at a hidden cell's location, and other cells are not affected.

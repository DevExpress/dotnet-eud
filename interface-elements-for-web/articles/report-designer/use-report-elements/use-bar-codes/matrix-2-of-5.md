# Matrix 2 of 5

**Matrix 2 of 5** is a linear one-dimensional bar code. **Matrix 2 of 5** is a self-checking numerical-only bar code.

Unlike the **Interleaved 2 of 5**, all of the information is encoded in the bars; the spaces are of a fixed width and used only to separate the bars. **Matrix 2 of 5** is used primarily for warehouse sorting, photo finishing, and airline ticket marking.

# Code 93

**Code 93** was designed to supplement and improve upon **Code 39**.

**Code 93** is similar in that, like **Code 39**, can represent the full ASCII character set by using combinations of **2** characters. It differs in that **Code 93** is a continuous symbology and produces denser code. It also encodes **47** characters (compared to **Code 39**'s **43** characters).

In the [property grid](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/properties-panel.md), expand the **Symbology** list and specify the following properties specific to **Code 93**:

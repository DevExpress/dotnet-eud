# GS1-128 - EAN-128 (UCC)

**GS1-128** (**EAN-128**) was developed to provide a worldwide format and standard for exchanging common data between companies.

While other barcodes simply encode data with no respect for what the data represents, **GS1-128** encodes data and encodes what that data represents.

# Picture Box

## <a name="overview"></a>Overview
The **Picture Box** control allows you to embed _static_ (stored with the report) or _dynamic_ (obtained from a data source) images into a report.

To add this control to a report, drag the **Picture Box** item from the [Toolbox](../../report-designer-tools/toolbox.md) onto the report's area.

The Picture Box can display images with the following formats: BMP, JPG, JPEG, GIF, TIF, TIFF, PNG, ICO, DIB, RLE, JPE, JFIF, EMF, WMF, SVG.


Use the **Image Source** or **Image URL** property to specify the image the Picture Box displays. You can access these properties in the **Actions** category.

The specified image is [saved](../../save-reports.md) with the report if you use the **Image Source** property. If you use the **Image URL** property, only the path to the image is stored. 

## Bind to Data

You can use the Picture Box to display an image [dynamically obtained](../../bind-to-data/bind-controls-to-data-expression-bindings.md) from a data source. Click the **Image Source** property's marker and select **Image Source Expression** from the popup menu. Then select the data field in the invoked [Expression Editor](../../report-designer-tools/expression-editor.md). You can use this editor to construct a binding expression that can include two or more data fields.

You can bind the **Image URL** property to data in the same way.

You can also drag and drop a field that contains image data from the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) to create a new Picture Box bound to this field.

See the [Bind Report Controls to Data](../../bind-to-data/bind-controls-to-data-expression-bindings.md) topic for more information about how to create data-aware controls.

## SVG Support Limitations
The Picture Box does not support the following SVG content:

* Gradient colors

* Text (you can convert text to curves as a workaround)

* Animations

* External .css styles

Export (except for PDF) has the following limitations:

* SVG images are converted to metafiles because document viewers may not support SVG format.

* SVG images are exported as PNG in the **Microsoft Azure** environment.

The **Medium Trust** permission level does not support SVG.

## Image Size Modes

Use the **Sizing** property to specify an image's position in the Picture Box. 

![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-modes.png)

This control supports the following image size modes:

* **Normal**
    
    The image is displayed at the top left corner with its original dimensions. The image is clipped if it does not fit the control's boundaries.

* **Stretch Image**

    The image is stretched or shrunk to fill the control's width and height.

    ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-mode-stretch-image.png)

* **Auto-Size**

    The control's dimensions are adjusted to the image's size.

    ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-mode-auto-size.png)

* **Zoom Image**

    The image is resized proportionally without clipping it to fit the control dimensions.

    ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-mode-zoom-image.png)

* **Squeeze**

    The image is centered and shown full-size if the control dimensions exceed the image size. Otherwise, the image is resized to fit the control's boundaries.

    ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-mode-squeeze.png)

* **Tile**

    The original image is replicated within the control starting from the top left corner. The replicated image is clipped if it does not fit the control's boundaries.

    ![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-image-size-mode-tile.png)

You can also use the **Image Alignment** property in the **Normal**, **Zoom Image** and **Squeeze** modes to specify the alignment in relation to the control's boundaries.

## Interactivity

You can add a possibility to load/change an image and/or draw a signature in a Picture Box when it is displayed in Print Preview. To do this, expand the **Behavior** category, select the **Edit Options** section and set the **Enabled** property to **Yes**.

![](../../../../images/eurd-web-picture-box-enable-content-editing.png)

Click the Picture Box in a previewed document and an editor invokes.

> [!TIP]
> You can draw borders for the Picture Box to make the editor visible in Print Preview, if an image is not specified.

Refer to the [Edit Content in Print Preview](../../provide-interactivity/edit-content-in-print-preview.md) and [Create an Interactive E-Form](../../create-popular-reports/create-an-interactive-e-form.md) topics to see how use this Picture Box mode.

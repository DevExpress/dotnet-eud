# Page Break

The **Page Break** control's sole purpose is to insert a page delimiter at any point within a report.

You can add this control by dragging the **Page Break** item from the [Toolbox](../../report-designer-tools/toolbox.md) onto the report's area.

This control is visually represented by a short line attached to the report's left margin.

The Page Break control is useful when you need to insert a page break between controls within a [report band](../../introduction-to-banded-reports.md) (for example, to divide subreports so that the second subreport starts printing on a new page).

You can also insert a page break before or after a specific report band using the band's **Page Break** property.

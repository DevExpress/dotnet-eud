# Sorting
* To sort data, click a row header. If sorting against this row hasn't been applied, the header click will apply sorting in ascending order. If sorting has already been applied, subsequent clicks reverse the current sort order.

* A click on a row header clears the sort settings on all other rows. To sort against multiple rows, hold the SHIFT key down while clicking.
* To clear a row's sorting, click its header while pressing the CTRL key.

# Manage Dependencies

## Add a Dependency

A dependency type specifies which edges (right or left - for preceding and succeeding tasks) serve as the start and end points for the dependency. 

Hover the mouse pointer over the preceding task's edge (marked with a circle) and drag the connector to the edge of the next task.

The following image demonstrates the "Finish-To-Start" dependency between tasks:

## Delete a Dependency

Right-click a dependency and select the "Delete Dependency" [context menu item](~/interface-elements-for-web/articles/gantt/context-menu.md). You can also select a connector and press **Delete** to delete the dependency between tasks.

# Add and Delete Dependencies

## Add Dependency

A dependency type specifies which edges (right or left) of the preceding and succeeding tasks serve as the start and end points for the dependency. 

Hold on the preceding task's required edge (marked with a circle) and drag the line to the required edge of the succeeding task. 

"Finish-To-Start" dependency between tasks:

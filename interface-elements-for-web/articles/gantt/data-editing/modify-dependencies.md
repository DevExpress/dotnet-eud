## Add Dependency

A dependency type specifies which edges (right or left - for preceding and succeeding tasks) serve as the start and end points for the dependency. 

Move the mouse pointer above the preceding task's edge (marked with a circle) and drag the connector to the edge of the next task.

"Finish-To-Start" dependency between tasks:

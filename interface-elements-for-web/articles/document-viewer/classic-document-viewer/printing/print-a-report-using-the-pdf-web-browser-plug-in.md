# Print a Report Using the PDF Web Browser Plug-In
If the PDF plug-in is not installed in your web browser, the default browser printing approach is used to print report documents. For details and issues related to this approach, see [Print Reports Using the Native Functionality of a Web Browser](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/document-viewer/classic-document-viewer/printing/print-reports-using-the-native-functionality-of-a-web-browser.md).

A web browser that supports the PDF plug-in allows you to secure consistent report printing results, and frees you from having to routinely evaluate print settings prior to each printing operation. This plug-in is available with the installation of **Adobe Reader&#174;**. Refer to the [Install and Activate the Adobe Reader Plug-In for Printing in a Web Browser](../../../../../interface-elements-for-web/articles/document-viewer/classic-document-viewer/printing/install-and-activate-the-adobe-reader-plug-in-for-printing-in-a-web-browser.md) topic for information on installing and configuring this plug-in in your browser.

To print the entire report document, click the **Print the report** ![web_buttonPrint](../../../../images/Img7539.png) button on the Document Viewer's toolbar. You can also print the currently displayed document page by clicking the **Print the current page** ![web_buttonPrintOne](../../../../images/Img7540.png) button.

When you click any of these buttons, the Document Viewer converts the report document to PDF. After this, the dedicated **Print** dialog is initiated to print the resulting PDF file. Converting a document to PDF preserves its layout, thus the document printed using the PDF plug-in will look on paper exactly as it was designed (pixel perfect printing).

The following image shows the **Print** dialog of the **Adobe Reader&#174;** plug-in.

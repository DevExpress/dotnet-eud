# Search for a Specific Text
To search for a specific text throughout a document, click the **Search** ![EUD_HTML5DV_SearchButton](../../../../images/img121840.png) button on the right side of the Document Viewer or on the Viewer's toolbar. This switches to the **Search** panel.

In this panel, you can input the text to find and specify whether or not to use case-sensitive search and whether it is required to match the whole word during the search. To start searching or search again, press ENTER. You can also use the ![EUD_HTML5DV_SearchButtons](../../../../images/img121842.png) buttons to continue searching backward or forward, respectively.

In addition, the **Search** panel displays the search result. So, you can quickly locate the required text within a document by selecting the corresponding item in the **Search Result** list.

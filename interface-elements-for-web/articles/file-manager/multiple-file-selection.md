You can select multiple files by doing one of the following.
* Use the arrow keys to move focus and the SPACE key to mark a focused file as either selected or unselected.
* Focus a file while holding the CTRL key to select or deselect a file without changing the other selection.
* Use the arrow keys or the mouse while holding down the SHIFT key to move focus.
* Click a file's check box to select or deselect a file without changing the other selection.

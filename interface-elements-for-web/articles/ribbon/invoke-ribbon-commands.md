# Invoke Ribbon Commands
To select a specific command, you can click it with the mouse or invoke it via its access key. See below for more information.

Access keys are associated with each tab and command in the Ribbon. Access keys can be visualized using **key tips**. The key tips are little boxes displaying access keys. To see the key tips, press CTRL+SHIFT+[_access key_]. The access key is defined by your application vendor. Key tips will appear next to the corresponding tabs and commands.

If an access key is represented by two or three symbols, to invoke the command, press the symbols shown in the key tip one after another.

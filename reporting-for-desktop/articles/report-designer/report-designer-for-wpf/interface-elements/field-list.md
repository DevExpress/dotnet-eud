# Field List
The **Field List** panel is intended to display the structure of the data source to which a report is currently bound. This panel can also be used to create new bound [report controls](../report-elements/report-controls.md), manage [calculated fields](../creating-reports/providing-data/calculated-fields.md) and [parameters](../creating-reports/providing-data/report-parameters.md).

This document consists of the following sections.
* [Creating Bound Report Elements](#binding)
* [Managing Calculated Fields](#calcfields)
* [Managing Report Parameters](#parameters)

## Creating Bound Report Elements
After [binding a report to data](../creating-reports/providing-data/binding-a-report-to-data.md), the Field List shows the structure of the report's data source assigned to the **Data Source** property. Then, the Field List can be used to add new bound controls.

To add a new bound report element, click a desired field item in the Field List, and then drag-and-drop it onto the report band. This creates an appropriate control bound to the selected data field.

## Managing Calculated Fields
The Field List allows you to create [calculated fields](../creating-reports/providing-data/calculated-fields.md) by building expressions based on the values of data fields, report parameter values, etc.

To add a calculated field to a report, right-click any item inside the data member node, and in the invoked context menu, select **Add Calculated Field**.

To edit settings of the created calculated field, select them and go to the [Properties Panel](properties-panel.md). You can also right-click the calculated field and use commands available in the context menu.

## Manging Report Parameters
The Field List shows existing [report parameters](../creating-reports/providing-data/report-parameters.md) and allows you to add new ones to the report.

To create a parameter, right click the **Parameters** node or any of its sub-nodes, and in the context menu, select **Add Parameter**.

You can customize report parameters using the [Properties Panel](properties-panel.md) or commands available in the context menu in the same way as you customize calculated fields.

# Change Measurement Units of a Report
For your report, you can choose its global **Measure Units**, which can be **Hundredths of an Inch**, **Tenths of a Millimeter** or **Pixels**.

To specify the **Measure Unit** property, do one of the following.
* Right-click the report and select **Edit...** in the context menu. In the invoked dialog, set this property to the required value.

* Select the report and switch to the [Properties Panel](../../interface-elements/properties-panel.md). Expand the **Measure Units** drop-down and select the required value.

This defines the basic measurement unit for all the unit-related options of a report and its [bands](../../report-elements/report-bands.md) and [controls](../../report-elements/report-controls.md) (such as location, size, border width, etc.) as well as the measurement unit of the report's [Snap Grid](control-positioning.md).

To select multiple elements, do one of the following.
* Click report elements while holding down the CTRL or SHIFT key.
* Click on a blank space and drag the mouse to create a selection frame. When the mouse button is released, all controls within the selection frame's boundaries will be selected. In this case, the previous selection is cleared.

You can also move multiple selected report controls in the same way as individual controls.

The report controls can be precisely aligned to each other using the **Snap Gird** and/or **Snap Lines**. For details on this, refer to [Control Positioning ](control-positioning.md).

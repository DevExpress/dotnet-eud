* In the Classic View, click the **New** button in the [Toolbar](../../interface-elements/toolbar.md).

* In the Browser View, click the plus button located inside the tab panel next to report headers.

As a result, the [Report Wizard](../../report-wizard.md) is automatically invoked allowing you to create the required report based on built-in templates.

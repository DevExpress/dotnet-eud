# Report Elements
In the Report Designer, a report is built from _controls_ (text labels, images, zip codes, charts, etc.) spread across report sections called _bands_ (various headers, footers, and content sections).

To learn more about these report elements, see the following documents.
* [Report Controls](report-elements/report-controls.md)

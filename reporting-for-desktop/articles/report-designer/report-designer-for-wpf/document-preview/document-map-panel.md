# Document Map Panel
The **Document Map** panel is an interactive table of contents, which reflects a report's structure in a tree-like form and provides quick navigation through its [bookmarks](../creating-reports/report-navigation-and-interactivity/add-bookmarks.md).

![WPFDesigner_DocumentMapPanel](../../../../images/img120299.png)

If a report contains at least one control with a specified bookmark, the **Document Map** is displayed by default. You can then toggle this panel's visibility state using the **Document Map** button ![WPFDesigner_PreviewToolbar_DocumentMap](../../../../images/img120178.png) in the [Toolbar](preview-toolbar.md). If a report does not contain bookmarks, this panel cannot be shown.

Click a bookmark in the **Document Map** to navigate the Print Preview to the corresponding element in a report document.

Note that after exporting a report to the PDF format, the **Document Map** is exported as well.

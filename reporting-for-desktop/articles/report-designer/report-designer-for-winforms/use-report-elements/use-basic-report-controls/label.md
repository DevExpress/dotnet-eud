# Label

## Label Overview

The **Label** control displays plain text in a report. Drag the **Label** item from the [Toolbox](../../report-designer-tools/toolbox.md) onto the report's area to add a Label control to it.

Double-click the label to invoke its in-place editor and enter the static text.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-static-text.png)

Press CTRL+Enter to submit text changes and exit the label's in-place edit mode.

## Bind to Data
### Display Field Values

You can [bind](../bind-controls-to-data.md) the label's **Text** property to a data field obtained from a report's data source. Click the control's smart tag, expand the **Expression** drop-down list and select the data field.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-bind-to-data-field.png)

Click the **Expression** option's ellipsis button to invoke the **Expression Editor**. You can use this editor to construct a complex binding expression from two or more data fields.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-expression-binding.png)

You can also drag and drop a numeric or text field from the [Field List](../../report-designer-tools/ui-panels/field-list.md) to create a new label bound to this field.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-drag-field-from-field-list.png)

See the [Bind Controls to Data](../bind-controls-to-data.md) topic for more information.

The **Process Duplicates Mode**, **Process Duplicates Target** and **Process Null Values** options enable you to hide a control when a duplicated or null value appears in an assigned data source.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-process-duplicates-mode.png)

You can also use the **Format String** property to specify output values' [format](../../shape-report-data/format-data.md).

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-format-string.png)

### Display Summaries

Specify a data range in the **Summary Running** property and select the summary function in the **Summary Expression Editor** to make the label display a [summary function's result](../../shape-report-data/calculate-summaries/calculate-a-summary.md).

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-summary-function.png)

## Adjust the Label Size and Content
### Static Content

You can change label size at design time to fit its static text. Right-click the label and select the **Fit Bounds To Text** toolbar button:

* If the **Word Wrap** option is enabled, the command displays control content on multiple lines. It reduces control height and adjusts its width to fit its content.

	![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-fit-bounds-to-text-word-wrap-enabled.png)

* If the **Word Wrap** option is disabled and the control's content is partially visible, the command adjusts the control size to display this content.

	![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-fit-bounds-to-text-word-wrap-disabled.png)

The command's result also depends on the control's **Text Alignment** and **Right To Left** settings.

Use the **Fit Text To Bounds** button to adjust the control's font size to fit its area. The **Word Wrap** option defines whether the text can occupy multiple lines or should be in a single line.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-fit-text-to-bounds.png)

These commands are not available in the following cases:

* A label's text is an empty string;
* A label's text is bound to data;
* A label's **Angle** property is specified.

Use the **Line Spacing** property to define the spacing between lines of text in a label. The image shows the difference between spacing:

### Data-Bound Labels

The **Can Grow** and **Can Shrink** properties allow you to increase or decrease the control's height according to its content in Print Preview mode.

| Can Grow is enabled | Can Grow is disabled |
|---|---|
| ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-can-grow-true.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-can-grow-false.png) |


| Can Shrink is enabled | CanShrink is disabled |
|---|---|
| ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-can-shrink-true.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-can-shrink-false.png) |

The **Auto Width** property specifies whether to adjust a data-bound label's width to its content.

You can also use the opposite **Text Fit Mode** property to adjust a control's font size to fit its boundaries in Print Preview. This property is not available if the **Can Grow**, **Can Shrink** or **Auto Width** option is enabled.

| Text Fit Mode = None | Text Fit Mode = Grow Only | Text Fit Mode = Shrink Only | Text Fit Mode = Shrink And Grow |
|---|---|---|---|
| ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-text-fit-mode-none.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-text-fit-mode-grow-only.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-text-fit-mode-shrink-only.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-text-fit-mode-shrink-and-grow.png) |

See the [Arrange Dynamic Report Content](../../lay-out-dynamic-report-content.md) topic for more information.

### Convert Labels to Table

You can convert multiple labels to a [table](../use-tables.md) to simplify control alignment.

Hold CTRL or SHIFT and click labels to select them. Right-click any of the selected labels and select **Convert To Table** from the context menu. A table with one row is added to the report instead of the selected labels.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-convert-to-table.png)

The **Convert To Table** option is not available if any of the selected labels overlap horizontally.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-labels-overlap.png)

The created table occupies horizontal space from the leftmost label's left edge to the rightmost label's right edge, and vertical space from the topmost label's top edge to the lowest label's bottom edge.

The horizontal gap between labels is included in the left cell.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-table-space-between-labels.png)

The table cells copy all property values from the labels.

## Interactivity

Check the **Enabled** option in the **Edit Options** category to allow users to [edit a label's content](../../provide-interactivity/edit-content-in-print-preview.md) in Print Preview mode.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-edit-options-enabled.png)

Click this label in a previewed document to invoke the editor.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-content-editing-in-print-preview.png)

Use the label's **Interactive Sorting** option to allow users to click this label in Print Preview to sort report data. Set the **Target Band** property to the Group Header or Detail band, and specify the data field in the **Field Name** property.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-win-label-interactive-sorting-options.png)

Refer to [Sort a Report in Print Preview](../../provide-interactivity/sort-a-report-in-print-preview.md) for a step-by-step tutorial.

## Markup Text

Enable the **Allow Markup Text** property to format the label's text with markup tags.

![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/eurd-label-markup.png)

**Label** supports the following tags:

| Tag | End Tag |  Supported in XLS / XLSX Export| Supported in DOCX Export| Description |
| --- | ------- | --- | --- | ----------- |
| **&lt;br&gt;** | **&lt;/br&gt;**  | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |Inserts a single line break. Enable the **WordWrap** property to use this tag. |
| **&lt;nbsp&gt;** | - | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Inserts a space. |
| **&lt;color**=_value_**&gt;** | **&lt;/color&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Specifies the text color. |
| **&lt;backcolor**=_value_**&gt;** | **&lt;/backcolor&gt;** | |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Specifies the background color. |
| **&lt;size**=_value_**&gt;** | **&lt;/size&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)| Specifies the font size. |
| **&lt;b&gt;** | **&lt;/b&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Defines bold text. |
| **&lt;i&gt;** | **&lt;/i&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |Defines italic text. |
| **&lt;s&gt;** | **&lt;/s&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |Defines strikethrough text. |
| **&lt;u&gt;** | **&lt;/u&gt;** | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Defines underlined text. |
|**&lt;r&gt;**|**&lt;/r&gt;**||![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)| Defines regular text. This resets any bold, italic, underlined, or strikethrough formats specified with tags or applied in the controlâ€™s appearance settings.|
|**&lt;sub&gt;**|**&lt;/sub&gt;**|| ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)| Specifies that the text is smaller and displayed lower than the previous character. Export to DOCX does not support nested sub elements. For example, double subscript: 2&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;|
|**&lt;sup&gt;**|**&lt;/sup&gt;**|| ![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)|Defines that the text is smaller and displayed higher than the previous character. Export to DOCX does not support nested sup elements. For example, double superscript: 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;|
| **&lt;image=**_value_**&gt;**  | - |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Inserts an image from the report's named image collection. Supports both raster images and SVG images. Use the report's **Image Resources** property to provide images and reference them by their **Id**. The **image** tag's **size** attribute sets the image display pixel size. If the specified width/height exceeds the label's width/height, it is reduced to display the entire image. Specify the **size** attribute after the tag's value followed by the ";" character. |
| **&lt;href=**_value_**&gt;** | **&lt;/href&gt;** | |![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png) | Displays a hyperlink. The value string specifies the hyperlink source, and the string between the opening and closing tags is the text to display. |
|**&lt;font&gt;**|**&lt;/font&gt;**|![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)|![](~/reporting-for-desktop/images/yes.png)|Specifies the font family. You can combine it with the color and size settings within a single tag.|

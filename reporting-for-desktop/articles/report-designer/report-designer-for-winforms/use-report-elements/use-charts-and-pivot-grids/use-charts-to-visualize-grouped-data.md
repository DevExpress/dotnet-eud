# Use Charts to Visualize Grouped Data

This topic describes how to use charts to visualize grouped data in a report.

In this tutorial, the report data is grouped against a data field (the report's group field). A chart is placed in the Group Footer band and is not bound to data. The report's data source is used to populate the chart with data.

Follow the steps below to make each chart instance display data for its group.

1. Select the chart. Open the [Toolbar](../../report-designer-tools/toolbar.md)'s **Chart Tools** contextual tab and click **Run Designer**.

	On the right side, use a chart parameter to obtain a group value from the report's group field. Click the right side's icon until it turns into a question mark and select **Add Parameter** from the context menu to invoke the Add New Parameter dialog.

# Micro QR Code

A **Micro QR Code** is a two-dimensional code. It is a more compact version of a standard [QR code](qr-code.md): a Micro QR Code can encode up to 35 numeric characters or 21 alphanumeric characters, enough to store a product ID or a short URL. In comparison, a standard QR code can contain up to 7,089 characters.

Micro QR Codes are often used in industries such as electronics, medical devices, and retail, where space-efficient labeling is essential.

Click **Next** to proceed to the next wizard page, depending on whether or not the created connection uses server authentication.
* [Save the Connection String](save-the-connection-string.md) - if server authentication is required, this page allows you to specify whether or not you want to save the user credentials along with the connection string.
* [Create a Query or Select a Stored Procedure](create-a-query-or-select-a-stored-procedure.md) - if server authentication is not required, the page above does not appear, and you will proceed to constructing the query.

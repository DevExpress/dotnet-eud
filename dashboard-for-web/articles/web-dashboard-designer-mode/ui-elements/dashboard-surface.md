# Dashboard Surface
The **Dashboard Surface** is a rectangular area that displays the dashboard that you are designing. This area includes [dashboard items](../dashboard-item-settings.md) and the [dashboard title](../dashboard-layout/dashboard-title.md).

You can customize a [dashboard items layout](../dashboard-layout/dashboard-items-layout.md) using drag-and-drop operations, and specify dashboard item settings using its [dashboard item menu](dashboard-item-menu.md).

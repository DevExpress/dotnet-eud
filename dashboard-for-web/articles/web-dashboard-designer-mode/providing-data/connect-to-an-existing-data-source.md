title: Connect to an Existing Data Source
---
The Web Dashboard allows you to connect a dashboard to one of the existing data sources or add these data sources to the dashboard's data sources collection.

## Connect a New Dashboard to an Existing Data Source
When you [create](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/providing-data/create-a-new-data-source.md) a new dashboard, the **New** page of the [dashboard menu](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-menu.md) is invoked and allows you to select the existing data source from the list.

This action creates a new empty dashboard that is bound to data.  Now, you can [add dashboard items](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/adding-dashboard-items.md) and [bind them to data](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md).

## Add a New Data Source to the Existing Dashboard
You can add an existing data source to the dashboard. To learn more, see [Manage Data Sources](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/providing-data/manage-data-sources.md).

# Manage Data Sources
The Web Dashboard allows you to manage the dashboard's data sources. To do this, open the [dashboard menu](../ui-elements/dashboard-menu.md) and go to the **Data Sources** page. Here you can add new data sources to the current dashboard or remove the existing data source.

To add a new data source, click **Add** next to the **Used Data Sources** list.

The **Add Data Source** window is invoked. Here you can perform the following actions.
* Click **Create** to invoke the [Dashboard Data Source Wizard](working-with-sql-data-sources/dashboard-data-source-wizard.md) where you can create a new data source based on the predefined data connection.
* Select the existing data source from the list.

After that, click **Add** to add the selected data source to the dashboard data sources.

The added data source will be displayed in the **Used Data Sources** section. You can use the added data sources to [change the data source](../binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data-in-the-web-dashboard.md) of the created dashboard items.

To remove the existing data source from the dashboard data sources, click **Remove** ( the ![WDD-icon-delete-data-source](../../../images/img124585.png) icon).

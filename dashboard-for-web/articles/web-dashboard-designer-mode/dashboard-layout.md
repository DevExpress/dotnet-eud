# Dashboard Layout

This section describes the features related to the dashboard layout.

## Dashboard Width and Height

The control automatically stretches or shrinks content (dashboard items) in a dashboard to fit available screen space horizontally and vertically. You can adjust layout options and specify exact content width and height.

As an alternative, you can set content size in pixels. If the width or height is too large, the Dashboard control displays a scrollbar.

Specify the following options in the [Designer Toolbar](ui-elements/designer-toolbar.md):

* _Auto_

    The height or width of a dashboard surface fits to content.
* _Fixed_

    The height or width of a dashboard surface is set in pixels.

## Dashboard Title
The Dashboard Title is at the top of the [dashboard surface](ui-elements/dashboard-surface.md) and can contain static text, svg images, and command buttons. These elements are called toolbar items:

# Grouping
The Web Dashboard allows you to group dimension values and display summaries for entire groups rather than individual values. You can arrange dimension values in groups of different sizes by specifying the appropriate group interval. For instance, date-time values can be grouped by year, month, quarter, etc.

## Changing a Date-Time Group Interval
Date-time values support the following group intervals.

## Changing a Text Group Interval
String values support the following grouping intervals.
* **No Grouping:** each value is displayed "as is".
* **Alphabetical:** values are grouped alphabetically (e.g., A, B, C, ... Z).

For string values, go to the _Data Shaping_ section of the data item menu. Here, you can change the group interval to alphabetical.

You can specify which information should be displayed within tile and group labels separately. To do this, go to the **Labels** section of the Treemap's [Options](../../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu. Here you can specify a type of the following elements.
* Tile labels
* Tile tooltips
* Group labels
* Group tooltips

The available types are similar for all elements. You can set one of these types.

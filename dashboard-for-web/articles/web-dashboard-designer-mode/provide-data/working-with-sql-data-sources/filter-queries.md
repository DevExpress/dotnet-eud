# Filter Queries
You can filter SQL queries constructed in the [Query Builder](../../ui-elements/dialogs-and-wizards/query-builder.md) by including _WHERE_ clauses in the query. You can also apply filters to either underlying or aggregated data, and limit the number of data records returned by the filter.

To filter a query, deselect added tables and click the ellipsis button of the **Filter** field within the [Query Builder](../../ui-elements/dialogs-and-wizards/query-builder.md).

This will invoke the **Filter Editor** dialog, which allows you to build filter criteria.

You can create complex filter criteria with an unlimited number of filter conditions. These filter conditions can be arranged into groups with **And**, **Or**, **Not And**, and **Not Or** operators. The Filter Editor displays filter criteria as a tree-like structure, in which each node can be edited separately.

In the Filter Editor, you can compare a field value with the following objects.
* **Value** - represents a static value.
* **Property** - represents another field value.
* **Parameter** - represents a parameter value. Click the **Create new parameter** button to create a new parameter and specify its name. To learn how to configure the created parameter, see [Pass Query Parameters](pass-query-parameters.md).

To switch between values, click a down arrow glyph in the operand value placeholder to expand the list of available objects.

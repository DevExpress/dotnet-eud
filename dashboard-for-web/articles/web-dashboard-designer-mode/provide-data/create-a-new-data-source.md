# Create a New Data Source
This topic describes how to create a new data source based on the existing data connection.

## Create a Data Source for a New Dashboard
The [New](../ui-elements/dashboard-menu.md) page allows you to specify a title for a dashboard and bind the dashboard to a data source. Click the **Create data source...** button to invoke the [Dashboard Data Source Wizard](dashboard-data-source-wizard.md) where you can create a new data source based on the predefined data connection.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL data connection requires a query or a stored procedure for further work. Refer to the following article for information on how to manage queries: [Manage SQL Queries](working-with-sql-data-sources/manage-sql-queries.md).

Select the data source type. The wizard guides you through the steps needed to configure a new data source.

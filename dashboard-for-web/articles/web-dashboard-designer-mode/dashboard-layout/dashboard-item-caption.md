# Dashboard Item Caption

Each dashboard item has a caption that is displayed at the top of this item. The caption contains static text and other information, as well as command buttons.

## Caption Overview

You can control the dashboard item caption's visibility.

* When the caption is **on**, it is always displayed at the top of the dashboard item. Some command buttons are displayed when you hover the mouse pointer over them.
* When the caption is **off**, it is not visible by default. Some command buttons are displayed in a floating panel when you hover the mouse pointer over them. 

Go to the dashboard item [Options](xref:117446) menu and use the **Show Caption** option to control the caption visibility:

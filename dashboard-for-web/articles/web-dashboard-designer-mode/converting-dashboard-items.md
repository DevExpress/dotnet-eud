# Converting Dashboard Items
The Web Dashboard provides the capability to convert data-bound dashboard items to another type.

To convert the selected dashboard item to another type, use the dashboard item's [Convert To](../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-designer-mode/ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.

> You can also created a copy of the selected dashboard item using the **Duplicate current item** command.

The Web Dashboard always preserves the following settings for data-bound dashboard items.
* The set of data items used to bind the dashboard item to data.
* Data shaping settings of data items and their names.
* A custom name displayed within the dashboard item caption.

The following settings are kept if the dashboard item is being converted to an item that also supports this feature.

# Add Dashboard Items
After [creating a dashboard](create-a-dashboard.md) and [provide data](provide-data.md) to it, add **dashboard items** to display visual or textual information in a dashboard.

To create a dashboard item, click the corresponding button in the [Toolbox](ui-elements/toolbox.md) or drag an item from the Toolbox into the dashboard surface.

This creates an empty dashboard item, which you can now configure.

To completely design a dashboard item, perform the following steps.
* [Bind](bind-dashboard-items-to-data.md) the dashboard item to data.
* Set specific dashboard item settings based on its type. To learn more, see [Dashboard Item Settings](dashboard-item-settings.md).
* Perform the required [data shaping](data-shaping.md) operations (such as [grouping](data-shaping/grouping.md), [sorting](data-shaping/sorting.md), [filtering](data-shaping/filtering.md), etc.).
* Use the [interactivity](interactivity.md) features to enable interaction between various dashboard items.
* Adjust the dashboard item's position and size (a [layout](dashboard-layout.md)) and specify the dashboard item caption settings.

To remove the dashboard item from the dashboard surface, use the **Delete** button in the [dashboard item menu](ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md).

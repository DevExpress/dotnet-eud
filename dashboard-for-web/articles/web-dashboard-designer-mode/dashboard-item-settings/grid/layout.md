# Layout
The Grid dashboard item allows you to customize its layout in various ways. You can manage the width of grid columns, specify the visibility of column headers, enable cell merging, etc.

To access the layout settings, use the **Layout** section in the Grid's [Options](../../ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.

The following settings are available.

* **Vertical Lines** - Specifies grid's vertical line visibility.
* **Banded Rows** - Specifies the different background for odd and even rows.
* **Column Headers** - Allows you to toggle column header visibility.
* **Word Wrap** - Displays cell content on multiple lines if the size of a dashboard item is insufficient to completely display the cell content on a single line.
* **Column Width Mode** - Specifies column widths of the entire Grid using one of the available modes.

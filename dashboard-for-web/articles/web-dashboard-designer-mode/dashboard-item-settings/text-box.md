# Text Box
The Text Box dashboard item is used to display rich text within a dashboard.

You can provide text by uploading file in the RTF format.

To do this, go to the Text Box's [Options](../ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu and click the ellipsis button in the **Text** field.

This invokes the Open dialog, which allows you to locate the RTF file.

> [!Note]
> The loaded RTF file's content in the Text Box can differ from the original RTF file's layout because of RTF to HTML conversion limitations and browser specifics.

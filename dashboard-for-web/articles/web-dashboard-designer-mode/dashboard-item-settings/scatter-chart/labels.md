# Labels
The Scatter Chart can display **point labels** that contain descriptions for data points, and provide **tooltips** with additional information.

To manage the visibility of point labels, open the Scatter Chart's [Options](../../ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu and go to the **Labels** section. Then, turn the **Show Point Labels** option on.

Here you can specify the type of content displayed within point labels, configure label overlap mode and set the orientation of point labels.

The following options are available.

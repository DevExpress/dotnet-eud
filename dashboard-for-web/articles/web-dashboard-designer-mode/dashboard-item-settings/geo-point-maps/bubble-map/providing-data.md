# Providing Data
The **Web Dashboard** allows you to bind various dashboard items to data in a virtually uniform manner. To learn more, see the [Binding Dashboard Items to Data in the Web Dashboard](../../../binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data-in-the-web-dashboard.md) topic.

The only difference is in the data sections that the required dashboard item has. This topic describes how to bind the **Bubble Map** dashboard item to data.

The image below shows a sample Bubble Map dashboard item that is bound to data.

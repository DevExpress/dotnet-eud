# Providing Data
The **Web Dashboard** allows you to bind various dashboard items to data in a virtually uniform manner. To learn more, see the [Binding Dashboard Items to Data](../../../binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) topic.

The only difference is in the data sections that the required dashboard item has. This topic describes how to bind the **Geo Point Map** dashboard item to data.

## Binding to Data in the Web Dashboard
The image below shows a sample Geo Point Map dashboard item that is bound to data.

The tables below list and describe the Geo Point Map's data sections.

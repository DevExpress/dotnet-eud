# Interactivity
To enable interaction between the Pivot and other dashboard items, you can use the interactivity features. These features include **Master Filtering**.

## Master Filtering
Data displayed in the Pivot dashboard item can be filtered by other master filter items. The image below displays the Pivot dashboard item filtered by [Tree View](../filter-elements.md).

You can prevent the pivot from being affected by other master filter items using the **Ignore Master Filters** button in the Pivot's [Interactivity](../../ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.

To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic.

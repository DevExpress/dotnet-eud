# Series
The Chart dashboard item supports different types of series - from simple bar and line charts to candle stick and bubble graphs.
* [Change Series Type](#changest)
* [Configure Series Options](#configurest)
* [Configure Series Point Label](#configurepl)

## <a name="changest"/>Change Series Type
By default, Chart visualizes data using the Bar series. To switch between series types, click the required data item in the **Values** section and select the required series type in the invoked data item menu.

 Click the ellipsis button to show all available series types.

## <a name="configurest"/>Configure Series Options
To configure common series options, go to the data itemâ€™s **Options** section.

Here you can specify whether or not to plot the current series on the secondary axis, configure point markers behavior, etc.

The following options are available.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Caption** | Specifies the series caption. |
| **Plot on secondary axis** | Specifies whether or not the secondary axis is used to plot the current series. |
| **Ignore empty points** | Specifies whether or not empty points are ignored when plotting the current series. |
| **Show point markers** | Specifies whether or not to show point markers for the current series. This option is in effect for the **Line** and **Area** series. Note that point markers are always shown when [Master Filtering](../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) is enabled for the Chart dashboard item. |

## <a name="configurepl"/>Configure Series Point Label
The **Point Label** section of a value data item allows you to enable series point labels and manage their settings.

![wdd-chart-series-point-labels](../../../../images/img125037.png)

For example, you can specify whether or not to show point labels or set the label overlap mode.

The following options are available.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Show Point Labels** | Specifies whether or not to show point labels for the current series. |
| **Content** | Specifies the type of content displayed within point labels. You can select one of the following options: _Value_, _Argument_, _Series Name_ or _Argument and Value_. |
| **Overlapping Mode** | Specifies the label overlap mode. You can reposition or hide overlapping labels or disable a resolving algorithm. |
| **Orientation** | Specifies the orientation of point labels. You can set default orientation or rotate point labels 90 degrees clockwise or counter clockwise. |

Bar series has additional settings.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Show for zero values** | Specifies whether or not to show labels for points with zero values. |
| **Position** | Specifies the position of point labels relative to bars. Point labels can be displayed inside or outside bars. |

# Labels
A Choropleth Map provides the capability to display titles within map shapes and allows you to manage what data to show in the shape tooltips.

To manage map titles and tooltips, go to the **Shape Labels** section of the Choropleth Map's [Options](../../ui-elements/dashboard-item-menu.md) menu.

The following settings are available.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Shape Title Attribute** | Allows you to select the attribute whose values are displayed within corresponding map shapes. Summary values are included to shape titles by default. |
| **Tooltip Attribute** | Allows you to configure information related to a hovered shape. You can choose whether to use a binding attribute to display as the title of shape tooltips (the **Use binding attribute** value) or specify a custom attribute from the dropdown list. |

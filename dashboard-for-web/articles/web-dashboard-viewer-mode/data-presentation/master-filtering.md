title: Master Filtering
---
The Web Dashboard allows you to use any data-aware dashboard item as a filter for the entire dashboard (**Master Filter**). You can select elements in a **Master Filter** item (chart bars, pie segments, grid records, etc.) to filter data in the rest of the dashboard by the selected values.

## Master Filtering Modes
The Master Filter item supports two selection modes.
* **Multiple**
	
	Allows you to select multiple elements in the Master Filter item. To enable multiple element selection, use the **Multi-Select** button (the ![WebViewer_MultiSelectionIcon](../../../images/Img22460.png) icon) in the dashboard item [caption](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-viewer-mode/data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.
	
	To clear the selection in the Master Filter item, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![WebViewer_ClearMasterFilterIcon](../../../images/Img22461.png) icon) in the dashboard item [caption](../../../../dashboard-for-web/articles/web-dashboard-viewer-mode/data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.
* **Single**
	
	Allows you to select only one element in the Master Filter item. When this mode is enabled, the default selection will be set to a Master Filter element. You can change this selection, but you cannot clear it.

# Interactivity
This document describes the **Master Filtering** feature, which enables interaction between the **Choropleth Map** and other dashboard items..

## Master Filtering
The Web Dashboard allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more, see the [Master Filtering](../../data-presentation/master-filtering.md) topic, which describes filtering concepts common to all dashboard items.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a shape (or multiple shapes) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected shape (or shapes).

To reset filtering, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![WebViewer_ClearMasterFilterIcon](../../../../images/img22461.png) icon) in the map's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md).

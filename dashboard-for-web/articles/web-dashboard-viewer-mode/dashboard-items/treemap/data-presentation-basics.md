# Data Presentation Basics
The Treemap dashboard item visualizes data in nested rectangles that are called _tiles_. Tiles corresponding to child values can be combined by parent values into groups. For example, the Treemap below displays combinations of categories and sub-categories.

The Treemap displays **labels** that contain descriptions for tiles and groups, and provide **tooltips** with additional information.

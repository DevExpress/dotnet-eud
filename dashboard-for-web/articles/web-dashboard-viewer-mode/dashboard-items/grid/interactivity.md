# Interactivity
This topic describes features that enable interaction between the **Grid** and other dashboard items. These features include **Master Filtering** and **Drill-Down**.

## Master Filtering
The Web Dashboard allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../data-presentation/master-filtering.md) topic.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a grid row (or multiple rows) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected record(s).

To clear the selection in the Master Filter item, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![WebViewer_ClearMasterFilterIcon](../../../../images/img22461.png) icon) in the grid's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.

## Drill-Down
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more, see [Drill-Down](../../data-presentation/drill-down.md).

The Grid dashboard item supports drill-down for rows.

When drill-down is enabled, you can click a grid row to view the details.

> [!NOTE]
> When **Master Filtering** is enabled, you can view the details by clicking the selected row.

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![WebViewer_DrillUpIcon](../../../../images/img22464.png) icon) in the grid's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.

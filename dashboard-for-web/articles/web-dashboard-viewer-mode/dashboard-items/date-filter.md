# Date Filter
The **Date Filter** dashboard item allows you to filter dashboard data based on the selected data range. The range can be relative (Last 3 Months), use fixed dates (01-01-2018), or presets (Month-to-date). You can also filter dates before or after a specified date.

The Date Filter item displays a set of intervals that can be used as quick filters:

## Date Picker

The Date Filter item displays a **Date Picker** that is a button with a drop-down calendar. A drop-down calendar allows the end-user to select a single date or a date range:

## Quick Filters

**Quick Filters** are buttons displayed within the Date Filter item. Each button is bound to a predefined date-time period that can be used to perform a selection. You can click the button to apply a custom period to a Date filter:

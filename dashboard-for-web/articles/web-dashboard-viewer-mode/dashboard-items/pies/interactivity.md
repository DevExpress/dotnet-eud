# Interactivity
This topic describes features that enable interaction between the **Pie** and other dashboard items. These features include **Master Filtering** and **Drill-Down**.

## Master Filtering
The Web Dashboard allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../data-presentation/master-filtering.md) topic.

The Pie dashboard item supports filtering by **argument** or **series** values.
* **Filtering by Arguments**
	
	When filtering by arguments is enabled, you can click a pie segment to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected argument value.

* **Filtering by Series**
	
	When filtering by series is enabled, you can click a pie to make other dashboard items display only data related to the selected pie.

To clear the selection in the Master Filter item, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![WebViewer_ClearMasterFilterIcon](../../../../images/img22461.png) icon) in the pie's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.

## Drill-Down
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more, see [Drill-Down](../../data-presentation/drill-down.md).

The Pie dashboard item supports drill-down on argument or series values.
* **Drill Down on Arguments**
	
	When drill-down on arguments is enabled, you can click a pie segment to view a detail diagram for the corresponding argument value.

	> When **Filtering by Arguments** is enabled, you can view the details by clicking a selected pie segment.
* **Drill-Down on Series**
	
	When drill-down on a series is enabled, you can click a pie chart to view a detail diagram for the corresponding series value.

To return to the previous detail level (drill up), use the **Drill Up** button (the ![WebViewer_DrillUpIcon](../../../../images/img22464.png) icon) in the pie's [caption](../../data-presentation/dashboard-layout.md) area.

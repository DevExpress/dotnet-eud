# Coloring
The Dashboard Designer provides the capability to manage coloring of dashboard item elements. You can choose whether to use a global color scheme providing consistent colors for identical values across the dashboard or a local color scheme that provides an independent set of colors for each dashboard item. The Dashboard Designer also allows you to edit colors automatically assigned from the default palette.

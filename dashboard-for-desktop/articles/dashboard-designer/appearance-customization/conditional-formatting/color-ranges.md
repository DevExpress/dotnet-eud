# Color Ranges
Color Ranges allow you to use predefined sets of colors to apply conditional formatting to different ranges of values. You can also use custom appearance settings for specific ranges.

To format values according the required condition, click the data item menu button, select **Add Format Rule | Color Ranges** and choose the required icon set.

This invokes the **Range Set** dialog containing the set of value ranges and corresponding appearance settings. The Grid dashboard item on the right displays the default formatting applied using the predefined set of 3 colors.

This dialog allows you to change the following options specific to Icon Ranges.
* The **Format Style** combo box allows you to change the color set used to apply formatting.
* The **Use % ranges** check box specifies whether the percent or absolute scale is used to generate ranges.

To learn how to specify custom settings, see the **Specify Appearance Settings** paragraph in the [Conditional Formatting](../conditional-formatting.md) topic.

	The _greater or equal_ sign includes the smallest value for the current interval while the _greater_ sigh excludes the smallest value from the current interval and includes it in the next interval.
* Use the **Add** and **Delete** buttons to add new ranges or delete the selected range respectively.

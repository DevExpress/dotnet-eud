# A Date Occurring
A Date Occurring format condition allows you to highlight date-time values that fall into a specified interval. Note that this format condition can be applied to dimensions with the continuous date-time group interval.

To format values according the Date Occurring condition, click the menu button of the required dimension and select **Add Format Rule | A Date Occurring**.

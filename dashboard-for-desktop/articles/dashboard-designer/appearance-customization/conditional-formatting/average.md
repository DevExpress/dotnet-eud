The **Average** format conditions allow you to highlight values above or below an average value.

The following condition types are supported for measures:
* <a name="above-average"/>**Above Average/Above or Equal Average**
	
	The "Above Average"/"Above or Equal Average" format conditions allow you to apply formatting to elements whose values are above/above or equal to the average. For instance, the following image displays a **Grid** dashboard item whose _Extended Price_ values that are above average (~ 141 000) filled in green.

For instance, the following image displays a **Grid** dashboard item whose _Extended Price_ values that are below average (~ 141 000) filled in red.

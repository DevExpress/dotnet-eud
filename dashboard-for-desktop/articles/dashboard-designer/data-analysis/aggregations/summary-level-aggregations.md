# Summary Level Aggregations
The Dashboard Designer aggregates data when you construct a [calculated field expression](../../work-with-data/creating-calculated-fields.md). This allows you to evaluate calculated fields on a summary level.

In the Dashboard Designer, you can use the following set of predefined aggregate functions:

![BlogDashboard_SummaryCalculatedField_Functions](../../../../images/img118142.png)

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| Aggr(SummaryExpression, Dimensions) | Aggregates underlying data using the detail level specified by a predefined set of dimensions and a specified summary function. To learn more, see [Intermediate Level Aggregations](intermediate-level-aggregations.md). |
| Avg(Value) | Returns the average of all the values in the expression. |
| Count() | Returns the number of values. |
| CountDistinct(Value) | Returns the number of distinct values. |
| Max(Value) | Returns the maximum value across all records. |
| Min(Value) | Returns the minimum value across all records. |
| Median(Value) | Returns the median of the values. |
| Sum(Value) | Returns the sum of all values. |
| Var(Value) | Returns an estimate of the variance of a population where the sample is a subset of the entire population. |
| Varp(Value) | Returns the variance of a population where the population is the entire data to be summarized. |
| StdDev(Value) | Returns an estimate of the standard deviation of a population where the sample is a subset of the entire population. |
| StdDevp(Value) | Returns the standard deviation of a population where the population is the entire data to be summarized. |

These functions can be used for all types of numeric fields. After creating such calculated fields, you can use them as measures contained in an OLAP cube.

## Custom Aggregate Functions

Along with the predefined aggregations (like Min, Max, Sum, Avg), the Dashboard supports custom aggregation functions. A Custom Aggregate function appears in the [Expression Editor](../../../../../interface-elements-for-desktop\articles\expression-editor.md)'s categories if the function was registered in your application.

The following image illustrates the custom _StringConcat_ function in the “Aggregate” function’s category:

![win-custom-aggr-function-in-expression-editor](../../../../images/win-custom-aggr-function-in-expression-editor.png)

Names of custom aggregate functions are stored in the _Custom Aggregate Names_ categories and can be used as arguments when you create [window calculations](window-calculations\calculation-functions-reference.md) as _WindowAggregate_ and _RunningAggregate_.

Refer to the following topic for detains: [Calculation Functions Reference](../window-calculations\calculation-functions-reference.md).

# Dashboard Layout

This topic describes the features related to the dashboard layout in the WinForms Designer.

## Dashboard Width and Height

The control automatically stretches or shrinks content (dashboard items) in a dashboard to fit available screen space. You can adjust the layout options and specify the width and height of content.

In the Ribbon menu, click the **Layout Options** button:

# Sorting
The Dashboard Designer allows you to easily change the sort order of values within a dashboard item. You can also enable sorting by parameter values.
* [Changing Sort Order](#changing-sort-order)
* [Sorting by Measure Values](#sorting-by-measure-values)
* [OLAP Sorting Specifics](#olap-sorting-specifics)

## <a name="changing-sort-order"/>Changing Sort Order
The sort order of dimension values is indicated with an arrow.

## <a name="sorting-by-measure-values"/>Sorting by Measure Values
Dashboard allows you to sort dimension values by summary values calculated for a specific measure.

To enable sorting by measure in the Designer, use the **Sort by** submenu in the dimension's menu.

You can also sort dimension values by the values of [hidden measures](../binding-dashboard-items-to-data/hidden-data-items.md).

## <a name="olap-sorting-specifics"/>OLAP Sorting Specifics
In [OLAP](../binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data-in-olap-mode.md) mode, you can use the following options to specify the sort order for attribute members.

* **No Sorting** - Specifies the default server sorting for the current attribute.
* **Sort by** - Allows you to choose the OLAP member property by whose values sorting is performed:
	* **(Value)** - sorting is performed by member values;
	* **(Display Text)** - soring is performed by captions associated with members;
	* **(Key)** - sorting is performed by member keys;
	* **(ID)** - sorting is performed by member IDs.

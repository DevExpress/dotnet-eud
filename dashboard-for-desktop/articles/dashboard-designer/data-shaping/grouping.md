# Grouping
The **Dashboard Designer** allows you to group dimension values and display summaries for entire groups rather than individual values.

You can arrange dimension values in groups of different sizes by specifying the appropriate **group interval**. For instance, date-time values can be grouped by years, months, quarters, etc.

This topic lists the supported text and date-time group intervals, and describes how to change the group interval.

The following sections are available.
* [Text Group Intervals](#textgroupintervals)
* [Date-Time Group Intervals](#datetimegroupintervals)
* [Changing Group Interval](#changegroupinterval)

## <a name="textgroupintervals"/>Text Group Intervals
String values support the following grouping intervals.
* **No Grouping** - each value is displayed "as is".
* **Alphabetical** - values are grouped alphabetically (e.g., A, B, C, ... Z).

## <a name="datetimegroupintervals"/>Date-Time Group Intervals
Date-time values support the following group intervals.

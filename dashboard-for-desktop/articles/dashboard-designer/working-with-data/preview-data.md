# Preview Data
The [Query Editor](using-the-query-editor.md) and [Query Builder](using-the-query-builder.md) allow you to preview data returned after a query/[stored procedure](stored-procedures.md) execution. To do this, click the **Preview...** button.

This invokes the **Data Preview** window containing data returned after executing the current query/stored procedure.

# Data Items Pane
The **DATA ITEMS** pane is placed side-by-side with the [Data Source Browser](data-source-browser.md), and allows you to create and modify data binding using drag-and-drop operations.

To learn how to bind dashboard items to data source fields, see the [Binding Dashboard Items to Data](../binding-dashboard-items-to-data/binding-dashboard-items-to-data.md) topic.

The DATA ITEMS pane can contain the following elements.
* **Data Item placeholder** - used to create a data binding using drag-and-drop operations.
* **Data Item** - identifies a data binding by mapping to a particular data source field. Each data item has the **Data Item menu** button, used to invoke a menu that allows you to perform various [data shaping](../data-shaping.md) operations.
* **Data Section** - corresponds to a particular dashboard item area or element.
* **Data Item container** - used to provide _data item_ sets (e.g., for calculating the difference between two measures). Data item containers have **Options** buttons that allow you to change specific dashboard item settings (e.g., to switch between chart series types or grid column types).
* **Sort indicator** - shows the current sort order for the data item.
* **Coloring indicator** - indicates whether coloring by hue is enabled for the data item.

Specific dashboard items have command buttons that allow you to perform various operations, for instance, to add a new pane to the chart dashboard item.

The **Dashboard Title** is located at the top of the dashboard surface. It can contain text or image content.

If you are using the Ribbon menu in the **Dashboard Designer**, you can change title settings by clicking the **Title** button.

This invokes the **Dashboard Title** dialog, which allows you to change the text within the dashboard title, add an image, etc.

This dialog allows you to specify the following options.

* **Show Master Filter state** - Specifies whether or not to show the state of master filter items in the dashboard title.
	
	When you hover over the filter icon (![DashboardTitle_MasterFilterIcon](../../../images/img23138.png)), all master filters applied to the dashboard are displayed in the invoked popup.

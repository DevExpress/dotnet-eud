# Coloring
Certain dashboard items provide the capability to color dashboard item elements by associating dimension values/measures and specified colors. You can choose whether to use a global color scheme to provide consistent colors for identical values or specify a local color scheme for each dashboard item. To learn more about coloring concepts common for all dashboard items, see the [Coloring](../../appearance-customization/coloring.md) section.

By default, the Scatter Chart dashboard item does not color its arguments. If necessary, you can change this behavior. For instance, the image below displays the Scatter Chart dashboard item whose _Product Category_ points are colored by hue.

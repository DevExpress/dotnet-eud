# Master Filtering
The **Dashboard** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more, see the [Master Filtering](../../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic, which describes filtering concepts common to all dashboard items.

The Scatter Chart dashboard item supports filtering by points that correspond to specific argument values or their combinations.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a point (or multiple points by holding down the **CTRL** key) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected point(s).

To learn how to enable Master Filtering in the Designer, see the [Master Filtering](../../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic.

To reset filtering, use the **Clear Master Filter** (![DataShaping_Interactivity_ClearSelection](../../../../../images/img19686.png)) button in the Chart's caption area, or the **Clear Master Filter** command in the context menu.

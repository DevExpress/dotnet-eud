# Coloring
In **Default** color mode, the Pie Map dashboard item colors its segments in the following way:

* If the Pie Map dashboard item contains arguments (the **Arguments** section), different argument values are colored by [hue](../../../appearance-customization/coloring/coloring-concepts.md).
* If the Pie Map dashboard item contains only measures (the **Values** section), values corresponding to different measures are colored by hue.

The image below illustrates the Pie Map dashboard item whose argument values are painted in different colors. A special icon (![ColoringIndicator](../../../../../images/coloringindicator25453.png)) on the data item shows that color variation is enabled.

# Point and Line Series
Point series visualize data as a set of individual numeric data points. Line series are used to connect numeric data points by different types of line segments.

The following types of Point and Line series are available.
* [Point](#point)
* [Line](#line)
* [Stacked Line](#stacked-line)
* [Full-Stacked Line](#full-stacked-line)
* [Step Line](#step-line)
* [Spline](#spline)

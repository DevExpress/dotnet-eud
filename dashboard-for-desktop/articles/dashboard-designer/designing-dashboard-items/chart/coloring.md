title: Coloring
---
Certain dashboard items provide the capability to color dashboard item elements by associating dimension values/measures and specified colors. You can choose whether to use a global color scheme to provide consistent colors for identical values or specify a local color scheme for each dashboard item. To learn more about coloring concepts common for all dashboard items, see the [Coloring](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/appearance-customization/coloring.md) section.

By default, the Chart dashboard item colors different measures and series dimensions by hue. In the example below, series points corresponding to different countries (_UK_ and _USA_) are painted in different colors.

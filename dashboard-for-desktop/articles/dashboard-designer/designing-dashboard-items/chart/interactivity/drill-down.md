# Drill-Down
The built-in drill-down capability allows you to change the detail level of data displayed in dashboard items on the fly. To learn more about drill-down concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Drill-Down](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/interactivity/drill-down.md) topic.

The Chart dashboard item supports drill down on argument or series values.

## Drill Down on an Argument
When drill down on arguments is enabled, you can click a series point to view a detail chart for the corresponding argument value.

> When [Filtering by Arguments](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/chart/interactivity/master-filtering.md) is enabled, you can view the details by double-clicking a series point.

Drill down on arguments requires that the Arguments section contains several data items, from the least detailed to the most detailed item.

> In OLAP mode, you can perform drill-down for either a hierarchy data item or several dimension attributes.

To enable drill down on arguments, click the **Drill Down** button in the **Data** Ribbon tab (or the ![Chart_Interactivity_DrillDown_Toolbar](../../../../../images/Img21873.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu)...

...and the **Arguments** button (or the ![Chart_Interactivity_FilterByArguments_Toolbar](../../../../../images/Img19511.png) button if you are using the toolbar menu).

When drill down on a series is enabled, you can click a series point (or corresponding legend item) to view a detail chart for the corresponding series.

Drill down on a series requires that the Series section contains several data items, from the least detailed to the most detailed item.

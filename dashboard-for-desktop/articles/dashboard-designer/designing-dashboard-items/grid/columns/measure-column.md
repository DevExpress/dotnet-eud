# Measure Column
A **measure column** displays summaries calculated against data in a bound data item.

Values in the measure column can be displayed as text or represented by bars.

To select between these modes, invoke the **Column Options** window (see [Column Type Overview](../../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-designer/designing-dashboard-items/grid/columns/column-type-overview.md) to learn how to do this) and select **Value** or **Bar**.

If bars are displayed, use the **Always show zero level** check box to specify whether the bar's zero level is always visible.

# Interactivity
This document describes the **Master Filtering** feature, which enables interaction between the **Choropleth Map** and other dashboard items.

## Master Filtering
The **Dashboard** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**).To learn more about the filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a shape (or multiple shapes by holding down the **CTRL** key) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected shape(s).

To learn how to enable Master Filtering in the Designer, see the [Master Filtering](../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic.

To reset filtering, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_ClearSelection](../../../../images/img19686.png) icon) in the map's [caption](../../dashboard-layout/dashboard-item-caption.md), or the **Clear Master Filter** command in the map's context menu.

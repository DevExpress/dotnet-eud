# Column Filter for a WinForms Grid Item

Column filters (filter row and header filter) allow users to search data in the Grid item. These filters do not affect data outside the Grid.

## Filter Row

The **filter row** allows a user to filter data by individual column values. To display a filter row, go to the Grid's **Design** Ribbon tab in the Designer and enable the **Filter Row** button in the **Column Filter** group:

![WinForms Designer - Display a filter row](../../../../images/win-designer-display-filter-row.png)

When the filter row appears, a user can enter the condition in the text box to filter column values:

The filter row's cells can be of different types--text boxes for string and numeric values, calendars for dates, and so on.

## Header Filter

The **header filter** allows users to filter values in an individual column. A user can include or exclude values from the applied filter to show the result.

The header filter is always enabled, so you cannot disable it in the UI. 

## Update Totals

A user can configure a Grid item to reflect changes in column values and recalculate [totals](totals.md) based on the applied column filters.

To update totals, go to the Grid's **Design** Ribbon tab in the Designer and enable the **Update Totals** button in the **Column Filter** group:

![WinForms Designer - Enable Totals Updates](../../../../images/win-designer-recalculate-totals.png)

As a result, the Grid item recalculates totals depending on the applied column filters:

## Limitations

### Filter Row Limitations

The following Grid [columns](columns.md) do not support the filter row:

- Dimension (for Image display mode only)
- Measure (for Bar display mode only)
- Sparkline
- Delta

A Grid item does not support a filter row for window calculations and calculated fields that use the w-function if the **Update Totals** option is enabled.

### Update Totals Limitations

You cannot enable totals recalculation in OLAP data sources.

### Other Limitations

Although column filters within a Grid item are case-insensitive, totals are calculated on the server and their case-sensitivity setting depends on the database settings. If case-sensitivity settings are different, the total value can differ from the Grid's data. Make sure that the Grid item and the database use the same case-sensitivity settings.

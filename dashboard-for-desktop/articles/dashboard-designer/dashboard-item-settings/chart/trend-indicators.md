title: Trend Indicators
---

The Dashboard Designer allows you to display trend indicators in Chart dashboard items. 

The following indicator types are available:

* Trend Line

    Displays the general direction of associated points. It is often used to identify existing data trends and can help forecast future trends.
* Regression Line

    Visualizes data using a mathematical formula that minimizes the distance between the line itself and associated data points. It is used to model the relationship between two variables and can be used to make predictions about one variable based on the value of another.
* Custom Indicator

    A custom indicator type registered in a dashboard.

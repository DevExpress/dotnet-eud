# Weighted Series
Weighted series allow you to visualize data in three dimensions.

The following types of Weighted series are available.
* [Bubble](#bubble)

## Data Binding Specifics
Data points in a weighted series present the following two measures.
* **Value** - the Y-coordinate of series points.
* **Weight** - the size of series points.

When you select the **Bubble** series type in the Designer, the [DATA ITEMS](../../../ui-elements/data-items-pane.md) area displays two data item placeholders. Drag and drop the required measures to corresponding placeholders.

## <a name="bubble"/>Bubble
Bubble series are similar to [Point series](point-and-line-series.md) except that they allow you to provide an additional measure whose values are expressed in a bubble size.

# Image Types Overview
The **Dashboard Designer** allows you to create two types of an **Image** dashboard item.
* The **Image** dashboard item allows you to add **static** images to a dashboard.

* The **Bound Image** dashboard item can be bound to a set of images (for instance, stored in the database). You can use the Bound Image as a detail item along with the [Master Filtering](../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) feature.

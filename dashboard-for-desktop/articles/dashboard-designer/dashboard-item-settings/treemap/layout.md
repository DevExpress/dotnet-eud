# Layout
This topic describes how to change a layout algorithm used to arrange Treemap tiles. To do this in the Designer, use buttons from the **Layout** group placed in the **Design** ribbon tab.

The following algorithms are available.

| Algorithm | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Slice and Dice** | ![Treemap_SliceAndDice](../../../../images/img125436.png) | This layout algorithm divides the space between items, slicing it in the specified direction depending on item value. |
| **Squarified** | ![Treemap_Squarified](../../../../images/img125437.png) | The Squarified algorithm arranges tiles so that their width/height ratio will be closer to 1. |
| **Striped** | ![Treemap_Striped](../../../../images/img125438.png) | This algorithm is a modified version of the Squarified algorithm. The difference here is that tiles are drawn side by side as columns or rows. |

You can also set a layout direction to specify an arrangement of tiles depending on their sizes. To do this, click the **Layout Direction** button and select the required direction.

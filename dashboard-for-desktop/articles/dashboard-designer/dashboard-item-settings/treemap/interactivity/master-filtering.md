# Master Filtering
The **Dashboard  Designer** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items. To learn more, see the [Master Filtering](../../../interactivity/master-filtering.md) topic, which describes filtering concepts common to all dashboard items.

The Treemap dashboard item supports filtering by tiles/[groups](../grouping.md).

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a tile or group caption (or multiple tiles/groups by holding down the **CTRL** key) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected tile/group(s).

> [!NOTE]
> If the Single Master Filter is used, you can select only tiles corresponding to the bottommost level.

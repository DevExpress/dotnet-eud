This document describes the capabilities that enable interaction between **Geo Point** maps and other dashboard items. These capabilities include **Master Filtering**.

## Master Filtering
The **Dashboard** allows you to use any data aware dashboard item as a filter for other dashboard items (**Master Filter**). To learn more about filtering concepts common to all dashboard items, see the [Master Filtering](../../../../../dashboard-for-desktop/articles/dashboard-viewer/data-presentation/master-filtering.md) topic.

When Master Filtering is enabled, you can click a callout/bubble/pie (or multiple callouts/bubbles/pies by holding down the **CTRL** key) to make other dashboard items only display data related to the selected callout(s)/bubble(s)/pie(s).

You can also select multiple callouts/bubbles/pies in the following way.
* Hold the **SHIFT** key and the left mouse button;
* Drag the mouse pointer, to mark an area that includes the desired elements;
* Release the left mouse button. All elements within the area will be selected.

To reset filtering, use the **Clear Master Filter** button (the ![DataShaping_Interactivity_ClearSelection](../../../../images/Img19686.png) icon) in the Map's caption area, or the **Clear Master Filter** command in the context menu.
